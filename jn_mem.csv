the milkeyed mender,2004,bridges and balloons,we sailed away on a winters day with fate as malleable as clay but ships are fallible i say and the nautical like all things fades and i can recall our caravel a little wicker beetle shell with four fine masts and lateen sails its bearings on cair paravel o my love o it was a funny little thing to be the ones tove seen the sight of bridges and balloons makes calm canaries irritable and they caw and claw all afternoon catenaries and dirigibles brace and buoy the living room a loom of metals warp woof wimble and a thimbles worth of milky moon can touch hearts larger than a thimble o my love o it was a funny little thingto be the ones tove seen o my love o it was a funny little thing it was a funny funny little thing 
the milkeyed mender,2004,the book of righton,we should shine a light on a light on and the book of right ons right on it was right on we should shine a light on a light on and the book of right ons right on it was right on i killed my dinner with karate kick em in the face taste the body shallow work is the work that i do do you want to sit at my table my fighting fame is fabled and fortune finds me fit and able and you do say that you do pray and you say that youre okay and do you want to run with my pack do you want to ride on my back pray that what you lack does not distract and even when you run through my mind something else is in front youre behind and i dont have to remind you to stick with your kind and you do say that you do pray and you say that youre okay and even when you touch my face you know your place and even when you touch my face you know your place we should shine a light on a light on and the book of rightons right on it was right on 
the milkeyed mender,2004,sadie,sadie white coat you carry me home and bury this bone and take this pinecone bury this bone to gnaw on it later gnawing on the telephone and till then we pray suspend the notion that these lives do never end and all day long we talk about mercy lead me to water lord i sure am thirsty down in the ditch where i nearly served you up in the clouds where he almost heard you and all that we built and all that we breathed and all that we spilt or pulled up like weeds is piled up in back and it burns irrevocably and we spoke up in turns till the silence crept over me and bless you and i deeply do no longer resolute and i call to you but the water got so cold and you do lose what you dont hold this is an old song these are old blues this is not my tune but its mine to use and the seabirds where the fear once grewwill flock with a fury and they will bury whatd come for you and down where i darn with the milkeyed mender you and i and a love so tender stretched on a hoop where i stitch this adage bless our house and its heart so savage and all that i want and all that i need and all that i got is scattered like seed and all that i knew is moving away from me and all that i know is blowing like tumbleweed and the mealy worms in the brine will burnin the salty pyre among the fauns and ferns and the love we hold and the love we spurn will never grow cold only taciturn and ill tell you tomorrow sadie go on home now and bless those who sicken below and bless us who have chosen so and all that i got and all that i need i tie in a knot and i lay at your feet and i have not forgot but a silence crept over me so dig up your bone exhume your pinecone my sadie
the milkeyed mender,2004,inflammatory writ,oh where is your inflammatory writ your text that would incite a light be lit our music deserving devotion unswerving cry do i deserve her with unflagging fervor well no we do not if we cannot get over it but whats it mean when suddenly were spent tell me true ambition came and reared its head and went far from you even mollusks have weddings though solemn and leaden but you dirge for the dead and take no jam on your bread just a supper of salt and a waltz through your empty bed and all at once it came to me and i wrote him hunched till four thirty but that vestal light it burns out with the night in spite of all the time that we spend on it on one bedraggled ghost of a sonnet while outside the wild boars root without bending a bough underfoot o it breaks my heart i dont know how they dot so dont ask me and as for my inflammatory writ well i wrote it and i was not inflamed one bit advice from the master derailed that disaster he said hand that pen over to me poetaster while across the great plains keening lovely awful ululate the lost great american novels an unlawful lot left to stutter and freeze flood lit but at least they didnt run to their undying credit 
the milkeyed mender,2004,this side of the blue,svetlana sucks lemons across from me and i am progressing abominably and i do not know my own way to the sea but the saltiest sea knows its own way to me and the city that turns turns protracted and slow and i find myself toeing thembarcadero and i find myself knowing the things that i knew which is all that you can knowon this side of the blue and jaime has eyes black and shiny as boots and they march at you two by two reloo reloo when she looks at you you know shes nowhere near through its the kindest heart beating this side of the blue and the signifieds butt heads with the signifiers and we all fall down slackjawed to marvel at words when across the sky sheet the impossible birds in a steady illiterate movement homewards and gabriel stands beneath forest and moon see them rattle boo see them shake and see them loom see him fashion a cap from a page of camus and see him navigate deftly this side of the blue and the rest of our lives will the moments accrue when the shape of their goneness will flare up anew then we do what we have to do reloo reloo which is all that you can doon this side of the blue its all that you can doon this side of the blue 
the milkeyed mender,2004,en gallop,this place is damp and ghostly i am already gone and the halls were lined with the disembodied and the dustly wings which fell from flesh gasplessly and i go where the trees go and i walk from a higher education for now and for hire it beats me but i do not know and it beats me but i do not know it beats me but i do not know i do not know palaces and stormclouds and the rough straggly sage and the smoke and the way it will all come together in quietness and in time and you laws of property you free economy and you unending afterthoughts you couldve told me before never get so attached to a poem you forget truth that lacks lyricism and never draw so close to the heat that you forget that you must eat 
the milkeyed mender,2004,cassiopeia,feel the mattress tense beneath me like the muscle of nonsleepy feathers flexing will defeat me and it vexes me completely and the hexes heat covertly like a slow low flying turkey like a texan drying jerky but his meaty mitts cant hurt me with my steely will compounded in a mighty mound thats hounded by the snap your steel string sounded just before your snores unwound it and in store are dreams so daring that the night cant stop from staring and ill swim sweetly as a herring through the ether not despairing go to sleep you stunning sky gently creep cunning by a quiet hum is amplified by your thumb that you suck dry hundred raging waters snare the lonely sigh and you hold your breath and clasp at cassiopeia hundred raging waterssnare the lonely sigh and you hold your breath and clasp at cassiopeia cassiopeia cassiopeia cassiopeia
the milkeyed mender,2004,peach plum pear,we speak in the store im a sensitive bore you seem markedly more and im oozing surprise but its late in the day and youre well on your way what was golden went gray and im suddenly shy and the gathering floozies afford to be choosy and all sneezing darkly in the dimming divide and i have read the right books to interpret your looks you were knocking me down with the palm of your eye nah nah nah nah this is unlike the story it was written to be i was riding its back when it used to ride me and we were galloping manic to the mouth of the source we were swallowing panic in the face of its force and i was blue i am blue and unwell made me bolt like a horse nah nah nah nah now its done watch it go and youve changed some water running from the snow am i so dear do i run rare and youve changed some peach plum pear peach plum

the milkeyed mender,2004,three little babes,there was a knight and a lady bright and three little babes had she she sent them away to a far country to learn their grammerie they hadnt been gone but a very short time about three months and a day when the lark spread oer this whole wide world and taken those babes away it was on a cold cold christmas night when everything was still and she saw her three little babes come running come running down the hill she set them a table of bread and wine that they might drink and eat she spread them a bed of winding sheet that they might sleep so sweet take it off take it off cried the eldest one take it off take it off cried she for i shant stay here in this wicked world when theres a better one for me cold clods cold clods inside my bed cold clods down at my feet the tears my dear mother shed for me would wet my winding sheet the tears my dear mother shed for me would wet my winding sheetwould wet my winding sheet

the milkeyed mender,2004,sprout and the bean,i slept all day i woke with distaste and i railed and i raved that the difference between the sprout and the bean it is a golden ring it is a twisted string and you can ask the councillor and you can ask the king and theyll say the same thing and its a funny things hould we go outside should we go outside should we break some bread are yinterested and as i said i slept as though dead dreaming seamless dreams of lead when you go away i am big boned and feyin the dust of the day and in the dirt of the day and the danger danger drawing near them was a white coat and danger danger drawing near them was a broad boat and the water wate running clear beneath a white throat and the hollow chatter of the talking of the tadpoles who know thoutside should we go outside should we break some bread are yinterested
the milkeyed mender,2004,what we have known,the tadpole buoyant as basalt the seahorse horsing in assault the owlet in his greenery the narwhal in his cup of sea they all believe they all believe but collusion bleeds through back alleys from parapets that end in feet when one is weak we discretely meet we throw the bones into the street as they progress we retreat and all the books our fathers wrote are in the middle of the road little by little we implode history brittle brown and broke we cant remember what was spoke so we stare in wonder at the smoke what it begets is born alone we know not now what we have known ladies breathe deep against your whalebones when your children come back made of stone and the terror seething sees a way it is like the wheezing of the bay in miniature agonies they travel westward on the breeze and bring us all to our knees and the dappled horse the sorrel mare with eyes that do not see but stare beneath boots as black as malachite he drives the nag into the night into the night and all the baby boys weve born with eyes averted from the storm sent off to die in perfect form we know not now what we have known satellite photos and rhetoric see how the euphemisms stick and when they come back broke and burned those who return have no return ladies breathe deep against your whalebones when your children come back made of stone
