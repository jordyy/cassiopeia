the meadowlark and the chimchooree and the sparrow set to the sky in a flying spree for the sport of the pharaoh little while later the pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow do you remember what they called up to you and me in our window there is a rusty light on the pines tonight sun pouring wine lord or marrow into the bones of the birches and the spires of the churches jutting out from the shadows the yoke and the axe and the old smoke stacks and the bale and the barrow and everything sloped like it was dragged from a rope in the mouth of the south below weve seen those mountains kneeling felten and grey we thought our very hearts would up and melt away from that snow in the night time just going and going and the stirring of wind chimes in the morning in the morning helps me find my way back in from the place where i have been and emily i saw you last night by the river i dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water frowning at the angle where they were lost and slipped under forever in a mud cloud mica spangled like the skyd been breathing on a mirror anyhow i sat by your side by the water you taught me the names of the stars overhead that i wrote down in my ledger though all i knew of the rote universe were those pleiades loosed in december i promised you id set them to verse so id always remember that the meteorite is the source of the light and the meteors just what we see and the meteoroid is a stone thats devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee and the meteorites just what causes the light and the meteors how its perceived and the meteoroids a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee you came and lay a cold compress upon the mess im in threw the windows wide and cried amen amen amen the whole world stopped to hear you hollering and you looked down and saw now what was happeningthe lines are fading in my kingdomthough i have never known the way to border them in so the muddy mouths of baboons and sows and the grouse and the horse and the hengrope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen and the mail is late and the great estates are not lit from within the talk in towns becoming downright sickening in due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare ive seen your bravery and i will follow you there and row through the nighttime so healthy gone healthy all of a sudden in search of a midwifewho can help mewho can help me help me find my way back in and there are worries where ive been and say say say in the lee of the baydont be bothered leave your troubles here where the tugboats shear the water from the waterflanked by furrows curling back like a match held up to a newspaper emily theyll follow your lead by the letter and i make this claim and im not ashamed to say i knew you better what theyve seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter let us go though we know its a hopeless endeavor the ties that bind they are barbed and spined and hold us close forever though there is nothing would help me come to grips witha sky that is gaping and yawning there is a song i woke with on my lips as you sailed your great ship towards the morning come on home the poppies are all grown knee deep by now blossoms all have fallen and the pollen ruins the plow peonies nod in the breeze and while they wetly bow with hydrocephalitic listlessness ants mop up their brow and everything with wings is restless aimless drunk and dour butterflies and birds collide at hot ungodly hours and my clay colored motherlessness rangily reclines come on home now all my bones are dolorous with vines pa pointed out to me for the hundredth time tonight the way the ladle leads to a dirtred bullet of light squint skyward and listen loving him we move within his borders just asterisms in the stars set order we could stand for a century staring with our heads cocked in the broad daylight at this thing joy landlocked in bodies that dont keep dumbstruck with the sweetness of being till we dont be told take this and eat this told the meteorite is the source of the light and the meteors just what we see and the meteoroid is a stone thats devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee and the meteorite is just what causes the light and the meteors how its perceived and the meteoroids a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee

from the top of the flightof the wide white stairs through the rest of my life do you wait for me there theres a bell in my ears theres the wide white roar drop a bell down the stairs hear it fall forevermore hear it fall forevermore drop a bell off of the dock blot it out in the sea drowning mute as a rock and sounding mutiny theres a light in the wings hits the system of strings from the side where they swing see the wires the wires the wires and the articulation in our elbows and knees makes us buckle and we couple in endless increaseas the audience admires and the little white dove made with love made with love made with glue and a glove and some pliers swings a low sickle arc from its perch in the dark settle down settle down my desire and the moment i slept i was swept up in a terrible tremor though no longer bereft how i shook and i couldnt remember and then the furthermost shake drove a murthering stake in and cleft me right down through my center and i shouldnt say so but i know that it was then or never push me back into a tree bind my buttons with salt fill my long ears with bees praying please please please love you ought not no you ought not and then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings cut from cardboard and old magazinesc makes me warble and rise like a sparrow and in the place where i stood there is a circle of wood a cord or two which you chop and you stack in your barrow it is terribly good to carry water and chop wood streaked with soot heavy booted and wild eyed as i crash through the rafters and the ropes and the pulleys trail afterand the holiest belfry burns sky high and then the slow lip of fire moves across the prairie with precision while somewhere with your pliers and glue you make your first incision and in a moment of almost unbearable vision doubled over with the hunger of lions hold me close cooed the dove who was stuffed now with sawdust and diamonds i wanted to say why the long face sparrow perch and play songs of long face burro buck and bray songs of long facesing i will swallow your sadness and eat your cold clay just to lift your long face and though it may be madness i will take to the graveyour precious longface and though our bones they may break and our souls separate —why the long faceand though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil —why the long faceand in the trough of the waves which are pawing like dogs pitch we palefaced and grave as i write in my log then i hear a noise from the hull seven days out to sea and it is the damnable belland it tolls — well i believe that it tolls — it tolls for me and it tolls for me and though my wrists and my waist seemed so easy to break still my dear id have walked you to the edge of the water and they will recognize all the lines of your facein the face of the daughter of the daughter of my daughter and darling we will be fine but what was yours and mineappears to me a sandcastlethat the gibbering wave takes but if its all just the same then will you say my name say my name in the morning so that i know when the wave breaks i wasnt born of a whistle or milked from a thistle at twilight no i was all horns and thorns sprung out fully formed knockkneed and upright so enough of this terror we deserve to know light and grow evermore lighter and lighter you would have seen me through but i could not undo that desire o desire o desire o desire desire desire desire desire from the top of the flight of the wide white stairs through the rest of my life do you wait for me there
and there was a booming above you that night black airplanes flew over the sea and they were lowing and shifting like beached whales shelled snails as you strained and you squinted to seethe retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry you froze in your sand shoal prayed for your poor soul sky was a bread roll soaking in a milk bowl and when the bread broke fell in bricks of wet smoke my sleeping heart woke and my waking heart spoke then there was a silence you took to mean something run sing for alive you will evermore be and the plague of the greasy black engines askulking has gone east while youre left to explain them to me released from their hairless and blind cavalry with your hands in your pockets stubbily running to where im unfresh undressed and yawning well what is this craziness this crazy talking you caught some small death when you were sleep walking it was a dark dream darlin its over the firebreather is beneath the clover beneath his breathing there is cold clay forever a toothless hound dog choking on a feather but i took my fishing pole fearing your fever down to the swimming hole where there grows a bitter herb that blooms but one day a year by the riverside id bring it here apply it gently to the love youve lent me while the river was twisting and braiding the bait bobbed and the string sobbed as it cut through the hustling breeze and i watched how the water was kneading so neatly gone treacly nearly slowed to a stop in this heat in a frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath press on me we are restless things webs of seaweed are swaddling and you call upon the dusk of the musk of a squid shot full of ink until you sink into your crib rowing along among the reeds among the rushes i heard your song before my heart had time to hush it smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking and when the fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say i was the last onescrape your knee it is only skin makes the sound of violins and when i cut your hair and leave the birds all of the trimmings i am the happiest woman among all women and the shallow water stretches as far as i can see knee deep trudging along —the seagull weeps so long —humming a threshing song —until the night is over hold on hold on hold your horses back from the fickle dawn i have got some business out at the edge of town candy weighing both of my pockets downtill i can hardly stay afloat from the weight of themand knowing how the commonfolk condemnwhat it is i do to you to keep you warmbeing a woman being a woman but always up the mountainside youre clambering groping blindly hungry for anything picking through your pocket linings —well what is thisscrap of sassafras eh sisyphusi see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain little sister he will be back again i have washed a thousand spiders down the drain spiders ghosts hang soaked anddangling silently from all the blooming cherry trees in tiny nooses safe from everyone —nothing but a nuisance gone now dead and done —be a woman be a woman though we felt the spray of the waves we decided to stay till the tide rose too far we werent afraid cause we know what you are and you know that we know what you are awful atoll o incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow bawl bellows ibyl seacow all done up in a bow toddle and roll teethe an impalpable bit of leather while yarrow heather and hollyhock awkwardly molt along the shore are you mine my heart mine anymore stay with me for awhile thats an awfully real gun i know life will lay you down as the lightning has lately done failing this failing this follow me my sweetest friend to see what you anointed in pointing your gun there lay it down nice and slow there is nowhere to go save up up where the light undiluted is weaving in a drunk dream at the sight of my baby out backback on the patio watching the bats bring night in while elsewhere estuaries of waxwhite wend endlessly towards seashores unmapped last week our picture window produced a halfword heavy and hollow hit by a brown bird we stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake and pant and labor over every intake i said a sort of prayer for some rare grace then thought i ought to take her to a higher place said dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you and though you die bird you will have a fine view then in my hot hand she slumped her sick weight we tramped through the poison oak heartbroke and inchoate the dogs were snapping and you cuffed their collars while i climbed the treehouse then how i hollered well shed lain as still as a stone in my palm for a lifetime or two then saw the treetops cocked her head and up and flew while back in the world that moves often according tothe hoarding of these clues dogs still run roughly around little tufts of finchdown and the cities we passed were a flickering wasteland but his hand in my hand made them hale and harmless while down in the lowlands the crops are all coming we have everything life is thundering blissful towards deathin a stampede of his fumbling green gentleness you stopped by i was all alive in my doorway we shucked and jived and when you wept i was gone see i got gone when i got wise but i cant with certainty say we survived then down and down and down and down and down and deeper stoke without sound the blameless flames you endless sleeper through fire below and fire above and fire within sleep through the things that couldnt have been if you hadnt have been and when the fire moves away fire moves away son and why would you say i was the last one all my bones they are gone gone gone take my bones i dont need none cold cold cupboard lord nothing to chew on suck all day on a cherry stone dig a little hole not three inches round spit your pit in a hole in the ground weep upon the spot for the starving of me till up grows a fine young cherry tree when the bough breaks whatll you make for mea little willow cabin to rest on your knee well what will i do with a trinket such as this think of your woman whos gone to the west but im starving and freezing in my measly old bed then ill crawl across the salt flats to stroke your sweet head come across the desert with no shoes on i love you truly or i love noone fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say that i was the last one last one clear the room theres a fire a fire a fire get going and im going to be right behind you and if the love of a woman or two dear could move you to such heights then all i can dois do my darling right by you 
when you ate i saw your eyelashes saw them shake like wind on rushes in the cornfield when she called me moths surround me thought theyd drown me and i miss your precious heart and i miss your precious heart dried rose petals redbrown circles frame your eyes and stain your knuckles dried rose petals —redbrown circles —frame your eyes and stain your knuckles and all those lonely nights down by the river brought me bread and water water in  but though i tried so hard my little darlin i couldnt keep the night from coming in and all those lonely nights down by the river brought me bread and water by the kith and the kin now in the quiet hour when i am sleeping i cannot keep the night from coming in whyve you gone away gone away again ill sleep through the rest of my days if youve gone away again ill sleep through the rest of my days and i will sleep through the rest of my days and ill sleep through the rest of my days whyve you gone away seven suns seven suns away away away away can you hear me will you listen dont come near me dont go missing and in the lissome light of evening help me cosmia im grieving and all those lonely nights down by the river brought me bread and water water in  but though i tried so hard my little darlin i couldnt keep the night from coming in and all those lonely nights down by the river brought me bread and waterin the kith and the kin now in the quiet hour when i am sleeping i cannot keep the night from coming in beneath the porchlight weve all been circling beat our dust hearts singe our flour wings but in the corner something is happening wild cosmia what have you seen water were your limbs and the fire was your hair and then the moonlight caught your eye and you rose through the airwell if youve seen true light then this is my prayerwill you call me when you get thereand i miss your precious heart and i miss your precious heart and miss and miss and miss  miss  miss miss  miss  miss your heart but release your precious heart to its feast for precious hearts 
i tell it as i best know how and thats the way it was told to me must have once been a thief or a whore then surely was thrown overboard where they say i came their way from the deep blue sea it picked me up and tossed me round i lost my shoes and tore my gown forgot my name and drowned then woke up with the surf a pounding it seemed i had been run aground well they took me in and shod my feet and taught me prayers for chastity and said my name would be colleen and i was blessed among all women to have forgotten everything and as the weeks and months ensued i tried to make myself of use tilled and planted but could not produce not root nor leaf nor flower nor bean lord it seemed i over watered everything and i hate the sight of that empty air like stepping for a missing stair and falling forth forever blindly cannot grab hold of anything no not i most blessed among colleens i dream some nights of a funny sea as soft as a newly born baby it cries for me so pitifully and i dive for my child with a wildness in me and am so sweetly there received but last night came a different dream a gray and sloping shouldered thing said whats cinched round your waist colleen is that my very own baleen no have you forgotten everything this morning round the cape at dawn some travellers sailed into town with scraps for sale and the saddest songs and a book of pictures leather bound that showed a whale with a tusk a meter long well i asked the man who showed it me what is the name of that strange beast he said its name translated roughly to he who easily can curve himself against the sky and i am without words he said my lady looks perturbed the light is in your eyes colleen i said whatever can you mean he leaned in and said you aint forgotten everything you dare to speak a ladys name he says my lady is mistaken i would not speak your name in this place and if i were to try then the wind — i swear —would rise to tear you clean from me without atrace have you come then to rescue mehe laughed and said from what colleenyou dried and dressed most willingly you corseted and caught the dread diseaseby which one comes to know such peace well its true that i came to know such things asthe laws that govern propertyand the herbs to feed the babes that wean and the welting weight for every season but still i dont know any goddamned colleen then dive down there with the lights to leadthat seem to shine from everything —down to the bottom of the deep blue sea down where your heart beats so slow and you never in your life have felt so free will you come down there with medown where our bodies start to seem likeartifacts of some strange dream which afterwards you cant decipher and so soon have forgotten everything
