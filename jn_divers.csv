sending the first scouts over back from the place beyond the dawnhorse bear your broken soldier eyes frozen wide at what went on and time in our camp is moving as youd anticipate it to but what is this sample proving anecdotes cannot say what time may do i kid with rufous nightjar when our men are all asleep it aint about how rare you are but how hard you are to see take you and me “when are you from” said he in our blind of winter leaves as we sighted out their fliers in the grayscale of the night fumbled on the bare ground to bury round landmines while the dew lay down and dried we signal private poor will when morning starts to loom pull up from your dive till we hear the telltale boom too soon hotdogging loon caught there like a shard of mirror in the moon now theyve stopped giving orders but i follow anyway laying in our state of torpor waiting out the day while the dew burns away rushing tearing speeding homebound to a wheel that is not my own where round every bend i long to see temporal infidelity and all along the road the lights stream by i want to go where the dew wont dry i want to go where the light wont bend far as the eye may reach nor end but inasmuch as that light is loaned insofar as weve borrowed bones must every debt now be repaid in star spotted sickle winged night raids while we sing to the garden and we sing to the stars and we sing in the meantime wherever you arein the folds and the branches somewhere out there i was only just born into open air now hush little babe you dont want to be down in the trenches remembering with me where you will not mark my leaving and you will not hear my parting song nor is there cause for grieving nor is there cause for carrying on and daughter when you are able come down and join the kettles on and your familys round the table will you come down before the sun is gone
the cause is ozymandian the map of sapokanikanis sanded and beveled the land lone and leveled by some unrecorded and powerful hand which plays along the monument and drums upon a plastic bag the brave men and women so dear to god and famous to all of the ages rag sing do you love me will you remember the snow falls above me the renderer renders the event is in the hand of god beneath a patch of grass her bones the old dutch master hid while elsewhere tobias and the angel disguised what the scholars surmised was a mother and kid interred with other daughters in dirt in other potters fields above them parades mark the passing of days through parks where pale colonnades archin marble and steel where all of the twenty thousand attending your foot fall and the cause that they died for are lost in the idling bird calls and the records they left are cryptic at best lost in obsolescence the text will not yield nor xray reveal with any fluorescence where the hand of the master begins and ends i fell i tried to do well but i wont be will you tell the one that i loved to remember and hold me i call and call for the doctor but the snow swallows me whole with old florry walker the event lives only in print he said its alright and its all over now  and boarded the plane his belt unfastened the boy was known to show unusual daring and called a boy this alderman confounding tammany hall in whose employ king taman end himself preceded johns fall so we all raise a standard to which the wise and honest soul may repair to which a hunter a hundred years from now may look and despair and see with wonder the tributes we have left to rust in the parks wearing that our hair stood on end to see john purroy mitchel depart for the western front where work might count all exeunt all go out await the hunter to decipher the stone and what lies under now the city is gone look and despair look and despair 
hay and a clean stall and ivy on a garden wall and a sign saying sold and an old coat for the bad cold i believe in you do you believe in me what do you want to do are we leaving the city on the black road through the gold fields while the fields are plowed towards what we are allowed the bridle bends in idle hands and slows our canter to a trot we mean to stop in increments but cant commit we post and sit in impotence the harder you hit the deeper the dent we seek our name we seek our fame and our credentials paned in glass trained to master incidentals bleach our collar leech our dollar from our cents the longer you live the higher the rent beneath the pale sky beside the red barn below the white clouds is all we are allowed here the light will seep and the scythe will reap and spirit will rend in counting toward the end in december of that year the word came down that she was here the days grew shorter i was sure if she came round id hold my ground id endure but theyd alluded to a change that came to pass and spring deranged weeping grass and sleepless broke herself upon my window glass and i could barely breathe for seeing all the splintered light that leaked her fissures fleeing launched in flight unstaunched daylight brightly bleeding bleached the night with dawn deleting in that high sun after our good run when the spirit bends beneath knowing it must end and that is all i want hereto draw my gaunt spirit to bow beneath what i am allowed beneath what i am allowed 
what we built at the kiln that wont be stilled did not set well the old veil of desire like the vessels that we fired fell thin as eggshells and every season somebody burns downtown taking turns—taking a bus to take a train and just plain vamoose now the wind blows coals over the hills honey ive been paying my bills but honey its been a long time since ive come to any use and it hurt me bad when i heard the news that youd got that call and could not refuse a goose alone i suppose can know the loneliness of geese who never find their peace whether north or south or west or east west or east and i could never find my way to being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me till the needing had ceased recently a bottle of rye and a friend and me on our five loose legs had a ramble and spoke of the scrambling of broken hopes and goose eggs and a stranger long ago not you honey you i know we just spoke of broken hopes and old strangers now the wind blows coals over the sea tell you what honey you and me better run and see if we cant contain them first but you had somewhere that you had to go and you caught that flight out of covalo now overhead youre gunning in those vs where you had better find your peace whether north or south or west or east west or east and i had better find my way to being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me at last at least whats redacted will repeat and you cannot learn that you burn when you touch the heat so we touch the heat and we cut facsimiles of love and death just separate holes in sheets where you cannot breathe and you cannot see and i cannot now for the life of me believe our talk our flock had cause to leave but do we do we
i believed they had got what they came for i believed our peril was done on the eve of the last of the great wars after three we had narrowly won but the fourth it was carelessly done saw his ship in its whistling ascension as they launched from the capitol seat swear i saw our mistake when the clouds draped like a flag across the backs of the fleet of the hundred first lightborne elite as the day is long so the well runs dry and we came to see time is taller than space is wide and we bade goodbye to the great divide found unlimited simulacreage to colonize but there was a time we were lashed to the prow of a ship you may board but not steer before you and i ceased to mean now and began to mean only right here to mean inches and miles but not years before space had a taste of its limits and a new sort of coordinate awoke making time just another poor tenant bearing weight taking fire trading smokes in the war between us and our ghosts but i saw the bering strait and the golden gate in silent suspension of their golden age and you can barely tell if i guard it well where i have been and seen pristine unfelled and i had a dream that i walked in the garden of chabot and those telescope ruins it was there that i called to my true love who was pale as millennial moons honey where did you come by that wound when i woke he was gone and the war had begun in eternal return and repeat calling where in the hell are the rest of your fellow one hundred one lightborne elite stormed in the new highland light infantry make it stop my love we were wrong to try never saw what we could unravel in traveling light or how the trip debrides like a stack of slides all we saw was that time is taller than space is wide thats why we got bound to a round desert island neath the sky where our sailors have gone have they drowned in those windy highlandshighlands away my john 
if i have the space of half a day im ashamed of half the things i say im ashamed to have turned out this way and i desire to make amends but it dont make no difference now and noones listening anyhow and lists of sins and solemn vows dont make you any friends theres an old trick played when the light and the wine conspire to make me think im fine im not but i have got half a mind to maybe get there yet when the sky goes pink in paris france do you think of the girl who used to dance when youd frame her moving within your hands saying this i wont forget what happened to the man you were when you loved somebody before her did he die or does that man endure somewhere far away our lives come easy and our lives come hard and we carry them like a pack of cards some we dont use but we dont discard but keep for a rainy day 
the diver is my loveand i am his if i am not deceived who takes one breath above for every hour below the sea who gave to me a jewel worth twice this womans life but would cost her less than laying at low tide to see her true love phosphoresce and in an infinite regress tell me why is the pain of birth lighter borne than the pain of death i aint saying that i loved you first but i loved you best i know we must abide each by the rules that bind us here the divers and the sailors and the women on the pier but how do you choose your form how do you choose your name how do you choose your life how do you choose the time you must exhale and kick and rise and in an infinite capsize like a bull tearing down the coast double hulls bearing double masts—i dont know if you loved me most but you loved me last recall the word you gaveto count your way across the depths of this arid world where you would yoke the waves and lay a bed of shining pearls i dream it every night the ringing of the pail the motes of sand dislodged the shucking quick and bright the twinned and cast off shells reveal a single heart of white and in an infinite backslide ancient border sink past the west like a sword at the bearers fall i cant claim that i knew you best but did you know me at alla woman is alive a woman is alive you do not take her for a sign in nacre on a stone alone unfaceted and fine and never will i wed ill hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life and ever hold my breath till i may be the divers wife see how the infinite divides and the divers are not to blame for the rift spanning distant shores you dont know my name but i know yours 
its the same old lady putting out the wash standing in the rain in her mackintosh same old lady standing in the rain the thought of new york was going insane hey little leaf lying on the ground now youre turning slightly brown why dont you come back on the tree turn the color green the way you ought to bemy mind is failing and my body grows weak and my lips wont form the words i speak and im floating away on a barrel of pain new york city wont see me again its the same old man sitting at the mill mill wheel turning of its own free will im certainly glad to be at home new york city continues on alone im certainly glad to be at home new york city continues on alone new york city continues on alone new york city continues   
and what do you remember most the line of the sea seceding the coast fine capillaries glowing with cars the comfort you drew from the light of the stars and how long did you climb that night with the ice in your lungs on the rungs of the light beyond recall you severed all strings to everyone and everything oh silent constant driver of mine wordlessly calling from the end of the line where even though each hour i ever loved must queue and dive still you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart in martial wind and in clarion rain we minced into battle wincing in pain not meant for walking backs bound in twine not angel or devil but level in time and i rose to take my shape at last from the dreams that had dogged me through every past when to my soul the body would say you may do what you like as long as you stay now the towns and forests highways and plains fall back in circles like an emptying drain and i wont come round this way again where the lonely wind abides and you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart alive you will not take my heart 
my life comes and goes my life comes and goes short flight free row i lie down and doze my life came and went my life came and went short flight free descent poor flight attendant but the sky over the ocean and the ocean skirting the city and the city bright as a garden when the garden woke to meet me from that height was a honeycomb made of light from those funny homes intersected each enclosed anelectric and alone in our lives is a common sense that relies on the common fence that divides and attends but provides scant defense from the great light that shines through a pinhole when the pinlight calls itself selfhood and the selfhood inverts on a mirror in an amora obscura but its mine or at least its lent and my life until the time is spent is a pinlight bent its a pinlight bent 
time passed hard and the task was the hardest thing shed ever do but she forgot the moment she saw you so it would seem to be true when cruel birth debases we forget when cruel death debases we believe it erases all the rest that precedes but stand brave life liver bleeding out your days in the river of time stand bravetime moves both ways in the nullifying defeating negating repeating joy of life the nullifying defeating negating repeating joy of life the moment of your greatest joy sustains not axe nor hammer tumor tremor can take it away and it remains it remains and it pains me to say i was wrong love is not a symptom of time time is just a symptom of love and of the nullifying defeating negating repeating joy of life the nullifying defeating negating repeating joy of life hardly seen hardly felt deep down where your fight is waiting down till the light in your eyes is fading joy of life where i know that you can yield when it comes down to it bow like the field when the wind combs through it joy of life and every little gust that chances through will dance in the dust of me and you with joy of life and in our perfect secret keeping one ear of corn in silent reaping joy of life joy again arounda pause a sounda song a way a lone a last a loved a long a cave a grave a day arise ascend areion rharian go free and graze amen a shore a tide unmoored a sight abroad a dawn unmarked undone undarked a god no time no flock no chime no clock no end white star white ship nightjar transmit transcend white star white ship nightjar transmit transcend white star white ship nightjar transmit transcend white star white ship nightjar transmit trans
