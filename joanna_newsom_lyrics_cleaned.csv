ys,2006,only skin,and there was a booming above you that night black airplanes flew over the sea and they were lowing and shifting like beached whales shelled snails as you strained and you squinted to seethe retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry you froze in your sand shoal prayed for your poor soul sky was a bread roll soaking in a milk bowl and when the bread broke fell in bricks of wet smoke my sleeping heart woke and my waking heart spoke then there was a silence you took to mean something run sing for alive you will evermore be and the plague of the greasy black engines askulking has gone east while youre left to explain them to me released from their hairless and blind cavalry with your hands in your pockets stubbily running to where im unfresh undressed and yawning well what is this craziness this crazy talking you caught some small death when you were sleep walking it was a dark dream darlin its over the firebreather is beneath the clover beneath his breathing there is cold clay forever a toothless hound dog choking on a feather but i took my fishing pole fearing your fever down to the swimming hole where there grows a bitter herb that blooms but one day a year by the riverside id bring it here apply it gently to the love youve lent me while the river was twisting and braiding the bait bobbed and the string sobbed as it cut through the hustling breeze and i watched how the water was kneading so neatly gone treacly nearly slowed to a stop in this heat in a frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath press on me we are restless things webs of seaweed are swaddling and you call upon the dusk of the musk of a squid shot full of ink until you sink into your crib rowing along among the reeds among the rushes i heard your song before my heart had time to hush it smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking and when the fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say i was the last onescrape your knee it is only skin makes the sound of violins and when i cut your hair and leave the birds all of the trimmings i am the happiest woman among all women and the shallow water stretches as far as i can see knee deep trudging along —the seagull weeps so long —humming a threshing song —until the night is over hold on hold on hold your horses back from the fickle dawn i have got some business out at the edge of town candy weighing both of my pockets downtill i can hardly stay afloat from the weight of themand knowing how the commonfolk condemnwhat it is i do to you to keep you warmbeing a woman being a woman but always up the mountainside youre clambering groping blindly hungry for anything picking through your pocket linings —well what is thisscrap of sassafras eh sisyphusi see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain little sister he will be back again i have washed a thousand spiders down the drain spiders ghosts hang soaked anddangling silently from all the blooming cherry trees in tiny nooses safe from everyone —nothing but a nuisance gone now dead and done —be a woman be a woman though we felt the spray of the waves we decided to stay till the tide rose too far we werent afraid cause we know what you are and you know that we know what you are awful atoll o incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow bawl bellows ibyl seacow all done up in a bow toddle and roll teethe an impalpable bit of leather while yarrow heather and hollyhock awkwardly molt along the shore are you mine my heart mine anymore stay with me for awhile thats an awfully real gun i know life will lay you down as the lightning has lately done failing this failing this follow me my sweetest friend to see what you anointed in pointing your gun there lay it down nice and slow there is nowhere to go save up up where the light undiluted is weaving in a drunk dream at the sight of my baby out backback on the patio watching the bats bring night in while elsewhere estuaries of waxwhite wend endlessly towards seashores unmapped last week our picture window produced a halfword heavy and hollow hit by a brown bird we stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnake and pant and labor over every intake i said a sort of prayer for some rare grace then thought i ought to take her to a higher place said dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you and though you die bird you will have a fine view then in my hot hand she slumped her sick weight we tramped through the poison oak heartbroke and inchoate the dogs were snapping and you cuffed their collars while i climbed the treehouse then how i hollered well shed lain as still as a stone in my palm for a lifetime or two then saw the treetops cocked her head and up and flew while back in the world that moves often according tothe hoarding of these clues dogs still run roughly around little tufts of finchdown and the cities we passed were a flickering wasteland but his hand in my hand made them hale and harmless while down in the lowlands the crops are all coming we have everything life is thundering blissful towards deathin a stampede of his fumbling green gentleness you stopped by i was all alive in my doorway we shucked and jived and when you wept i was gone see i got gone when i got wise but i cant with certainty say we survived then down and down and down and down and down and deeper stoke without sound the blameless flames you endless sleeper through fire below and fire above and fire within sleep through the things that couldnt have been if you hadnt have been and when the fire moves away fire moves away son and why would you say i was the last one all my bones they are gone gone gone take my bones i dont need none cold cold cupboard lord nothing to chew on suck all day on a cherry stone dig a little hole not three inches round spit your pit in a hole in the ground weep upon the spot for the starving of me till up grows a fine young cherry tree when the bough breaks whatll you make for mea little willow cabin to rest on your knee well what will i do with a trinket such as this think of your woman whos gone to the west but im starving and freezing in my measly old bed then ill crawl across the salt flats to stroke your sweet head come across the desert with no shoes on i love you truly or i love noone fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say that i was the last one

joanna newsom and the ys street band,2007,colleen,i tell it as i best know how and thats the way it was told to me must have once been a thief or a whore then surely was thrown overboard where they say i came their way from the deep blue sea it picked me up and tossed me round i lost my shoes and tore my gown forgot my name and drowned then woke up with the surf a pounding it seemed i had been run aground well they took me in and shod my feet and taught me prayers for chastity and said my name would be colleen and i was blessed among all women to have forgotten everything and as the weeks and months ensued i tried to make myself of use tilled and planted but could not produce not root nor leaf nor flower nor bean lord it seemed i over watered everything and i hate the sight of that empty air like stepping for a missing stair and falling forth forever blindly cannot grab hold of anything no not i most blessed among colleens i dream some nights of a funny sea as soft as a newly born baby it cries for me so pitifully and i dive for my child with a wildness in me and am so sweetly there received but last night came a different dream a gray and sloping shouldered thing said whats cinched round your waist colleen is that my very own baleen no have you forgotten everything this morning round the cape at dawn some travellers sailed into town with scraps for sale and the saddest songs and a book of pictures leather bound that showed a whale with a tusk a meter long well i asked the man who showed it me what is the name of that strange beast he said its name translated roughly to he who easily can curve himself against the sky and i am without words he said my lady looks perturbed the light is in your eyes colleen i said whatever can you mean he leaned in and said you aint forgotten everything you dare to speak a ladys name he says my lady is mistaken i would not speak your name in this place and if i were to try then the wind — i swear —would rise to tear you clean from me without atrace have you come then to rescue mehe laughed and said from what colleenyou dried and dressed most willingly you corseted and caught the dread diseaseby which one comes to know such peace well its true that i came to know such things asthe laws that govern propertyand the herbs to feed the babes that wean and the welting weight for every season but still i dont know any goddamned colleen then dive down there with the lights to leadthat seem to shine from everything —down to the bottom of the deep blue sea down where your heart beats so slow and you never in your life have felt so free will you come down there with medown where our bodies start to seem likeartifacts of some strange dream which afterwards you cant decipher and so soon have forgotten everything
