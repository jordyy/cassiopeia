ys 2006,emily,the meadowlark and the chimchooree and the sparrowset to the sky in a flying spree for the sport of the pharaoh little while later the pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow do you remember what they called up to you and me in our windowthere is a rusty light on the pines tonight sun pouring wine lord or marrow into thebones of the birches and the spires of the churches jutting out from the shadows the yoke and the axe and the old smokestacks and the bale and the barrow —and everything sloped like it was dragged from a rope in the mouth of the south below we’ve seen those mountains kneeling felten and grey we thought our very hearts would up and melt away from that snow in the nighttime just going and goingand the stirring of wind chimesin the morningin the morning helps me find my way back infrom the place where i have been —and emily i saw you last night by the river i dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water —frowning at the angle where they were lost and slipped under forever in a mudcloud micaspangled like the sky’d been breathing on a mirror anyhow i sat by your side by the water you taught me the names of the stars overhead that i wrote down in my ledger —though all i knew of the rote universe were those pleiades loosed in december i promised you i’d set them to verse so i’d always remember that the meteorite is the source of the light and the meteor’s just what we see and the meteoroid is a stone that’s devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee and the meteorite’s just what causes the light and the meteor’s how it’s perceived and the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee you came and lay a cold compress upon the mess i’m in threw the windows wide and cried amen amen amen the whole world stopped to hear you hollering and you looked down and saw now what was happeningthe lines are fading in my kingdomthough i have never known the way to border them in so the muddy mouths of baboons and sows and the grouse and the horse and the hengrope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen and the mail is late and the great estates are not lit from within the talk in town’s becoming downright sickening in due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare i’ve seen your bravery and i will follow you there and row through the nighttime so healthy gone healthy all of a sudden in search of a midwifewho can help mewho can help me help me find my way back in and there are worries where i’ve been and say say say in the lee of the baydon’t be bothered leave your troubles here where the tugboats shear the water from the waterflanked by furrows curling back like a match held up to a newspaper emily they’ll follow your lead by the letter and i make this claim and i’m not ashamed to say i knew you better what they’ve seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter let us go though we know it’s a hopeless endeavor the ties that bind they are barbed and spined and hold us close forever though there is nothing would help me come to grips witha sky that is gaping and yawning there is a song i woke with on my lips as you sailed your great ship towards the morning come on home the poppies are all grown kneedeep by now blossoms all have fallen and the pollen ruins the plow peonies nod in the breeze and while they wetly bowwith hydrocephalitic listlessness ants mop up their brow and everything with wings is restless aimless drunk and dour butterflies and birds collide at hot ungodly hours and my claycolored motherlessness rangily reclines —come on home now all my bones are dolorous with vines pa pointed out to me for the hundredth time tonight the way the ladle leads to a dirtred bullet of light squint skyward and listen —loving him we move within his bordersjust asterisms in the stars’ set order we could stand for a century staring with our heads cocked in the broad daylight at this thingjoy landlocked in bodies that don’t keep —dumbstruck with the sweetness of being till we don’t be told take this and eat this told the meteorite is the source of the light and the meteor’s just what we see and the meteoroid is a stone that’s devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee and the meteorite is just what causes the light and the meteor’s how it’s perceived and the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee

ys 2006,only skin,and there was a booming above you that night black airplanes flew over the sea and they were lowing and shifting likebeached whales shelled snails as you strained and you squinted to seethe retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry you froze in your sand shoal prayed for your poor soul sky was a bread roll soaking in a milkbowl and when the bread broke —fell in bricks of wet smoke —my sleeping heart woke and my waking heart spoke then there was a silence you took to mean somethingrun sing for alive you will evermore be and the plague of the greasy black engines askulkinghas gone east while you’re left to explain them to me —releasedfrom their hairless and blind cavalry with your hands in your pockets stubbily runningto where i’m unfresh undressed and yawning

there is cold clay forevera toothless hounddog choking on a feather but i took my fishing pole fearing your fever down to the swimming hole where there grows a bitter herbthat blooms but one day a year by the riverside —i’d bring it hereapply it gentlyto the love you’ve lent me while the river was twisting and braiding the bait bobbedand the string sobbed as it cut through the hustling breeze and i watched how the water was kneading so neatly gone treacly nearly slowed to a stop in this heat in a frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath press on me we are restless things webs of seaweed are swaddling and you call upon the dusk of themusk of a squidshot full of ink until you sink into your crib rowing along among the reeds among the rushes i heard your song before my heart had time to hush itsmell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking and when the fire moves away fire moves away son why would you say i was the last onescrape your knee it is only skin makes the sound of violins and when i cut your hair and leave the birds all of the trimmings i am the happiest woman among all women and the shallow water stretches as far as i can see knee deep trudging along —the seagull weeps ‘so long’ —humming a threshing song —until the night is over hold on hold on hold your horses back from the fickle dawn i have got some business

said a sort of prayer for some rare grace then thought i ought to take her to a higher place said “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you and though you die bird you will have a fine view ”then in my hot hand she slumped her sick weight we tramped through the poison oak heartbroke and inchoate the dogs were snapping and you cuffed their collarswhile i climbed the treehouse then how i
