1,Walnut Whales (2002),Cassiopeia,"Feel the mattress tense beneath melike the muscle of non-sleepy; feathers flexing will defeat me, and it vexes me completely. And his hexes heat covertlylike a slow low-flying turkey, like a Texan drying jerkybut his meaty mitts can't hurt me. With my steely will compoundedin a mighty mound that's houndedby the snap your steel string soundedjust before your snores unwound it And in store are dreams so daringthat the night can't stop from staring. I'll swim sweetly as a herringthrough the ether, not despairing. Go to sleep, you stunning sky; gently creep cunning by. A quiet hum is amplifiedby your thumb, that you suck dry. Hundred raging waterssnare the lonely sigh. Hold your breathand clasp at Cassiopeia. Hundred raging waterssnare the lonely sigh. Hold your breathand clasp at Cassiopeia.

2,Walnut Whales (2002),"Peach, Plumb, Pear","We speak in the store I'm a sensitive boreand you're markedly moreand I'm oozing surprise. But it's late in the dayand you're well on your wayand my Valentine's grayand I'm suddenly shy. And the gathering flooziesafford to be choosyand all sneezing darklyin the dimming divide. I have read the right booksto interpret your looksand you're knocking me downwith the palm of your eye. Nah nah nah nah. . . This is unlike the storyit was written to be I am riding its backwhen it used to ride me. And we are galloping manicto the mouth of the source And we are swallowing panicin the face of its force. I am blue. I am blue. I am blue and unwell, so I bolt like a horse. Oh, you're so gone. To chew some ice. And you've changed some. Reduced to tongue eardrum thumb pencil and price. I'm so dear. I run rare. I run rare. But you've changed some: peach, plum, pear. Peach plum! "
3,Walnut Whales (2002),Clam Crab Cockle Cowrie,"That means no where I come from. I am cold, and waiting for the day to come. I chew my lips, and I scratch my nose: feels so good to be a rose. Oh don't, don't you lift me uplike I'm so shy, no no no no no, just give it up —See there are bats all dissolving in a rowinto the wishy-washy dark that can't let go. I cannot let go, so I thank the lord, and I thank his sword! 'tho it be mincing up the morning, slightly bored O, morning without warning like a hole, And I watch you go. There are some morningswhen the sky looks like a road. There are some dragonswho were built to have and hold. And some machinesare dropped from great heights lovingly. And some great bellies ache with many bumblebees. I do as I please. Now I'm on my knees. Your skin is something that I stir into my tea. And I am watching youand you are starry, starry, starryand you will never ever know how very sorryyou will be. . . I am. Now I'm tumbling down, and I check a frown. That's why I love this town. Well, just look aroundto see me serenaded hourly! celebrated sourly! dedicated dourly; waltzing with the open sea —clam, crab, cockle, cowrie: will you just look at me? "
4,Walnut Whales (2002),Flying a Kite,"Dear charming kite Do lightly bite The foggy fields, the lowing lanes The rickety roads and the kneeling plains Oh lazy light With massive might You dare my dream of snowy cloth Felt snapping white as albatross Is bitten by the wind and rocks Is hushed into the clary [? ] moss Is ushered here to count his loss My kite, pale cotton, willow crossed You take my tattered fist It's like a catalyst It's like a roiling writhing wall of ""has it come to this? ""If this is medicine woah-oh It tastes like medicine Just help me get it in Flying a kite Flying a Kite flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying Flying a kite Oh-woah-oh[x2]Oh gnarly night It's like a dog fight It's like a cat fight And if I could just hold you close to me, woah-oh I guess I'd hold you close to me It's like a bull fight And I say I give you a piece of my mind But I'm giving you a piece of my mouth You blushing boy how could you be so blind? Flying a kite Flying a Kite flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying a kite-Flying Flying a kite Oh-woah-oh[x2]La da-da, de di Look at my kite fly Over foggy fields The pungent pines The verdant vales And the vapid vines And the thousand purple cups of wine The tearing teeth and the four full tines The crumpling feast and the dawdling dying And you do Pick me off the floor Stand there staring for a minute Like you never saw a girl before There is the door At night the streets are like an open mouth I head south And you stand fair and square and I stand there Until the fall blots me out There is no more The cat and mouse to block the door There is no more"
5,Walnut Whales (2002),The Fray,"Bottom of the ninth inning At which I stray through the crowd First it was what I call quiet Then it was biblically loud You should have seen how they tumbled You should have seen how they danced You should have seen them all luscious and lean As they flew by the seat of their pants It was not the boilin' frustration It was not that I cannot care less It was not the face of that reverent place In the horrible state of undress I moved in a way I call mindless I flatter myself a move true I carved out a ""J"" in the spectators' fray Because that's just the thing that we do Yes, I carved out my name in the ninth of the game Because that's just a thing that we do"
6,Walnut Whales (2002),En Gallop!,"This place is damp and ghostly I am already gone. And the halls were linedwith the disembodied and the dustly wings, which fell from flesh gasplessly. And I go where the trees are, and I walk from a higher education(for now, and for hire). It beats me, but I do not know. It beats me, but I do not know. It beats me, but I do not know. I do not know. Palaces and stormcloudsthe rough, straggly sage, and the smokeand the way it will all come together(in quietness, in time). Bitch, you laws of propertybitch, you free economybitch, you unending afterthoughts, you could've told me before —Never get so attached to a poemyou forget truth that lacks lyricism; never draw so close to the heatthat you forget that you must eat. In order to make the musicseems I must break so many things. Turn over like bracken and sea-shrapnelgrazed by the tongue of a beetle-green sea. Let each note bea full-bodied song: enough fingers, enough toes, skin to cover the rich, bloody beat, enough belly, enough feet. "
7,Walnut Whales (2002),The Book of Right-On,"We should shine a light on, a light on. And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on. We should shine a light on, a light on. And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on. I killed my dinner with karate —kick 'em in the face, taste the body; shallow work is the work that I do. Do you want to sit at my table? My fighting fame is fabledand fortune finds me fit and able. And you do say that you do pray, and you say that you're okay. Do you want to run with my pack? Do you want to ride on my back? Pray that what you lack does not distract. And even when you run through my mindsomething else is in front; you're behind. And I don't have to remind youto stick with your kind. And you do say that you do pray, and you say that you're okay. And even when you touch my faceyou know your place. And even when you touch my faceyou know your place. We should shine a light on, a light on. And the book of right-on's right on, it was right on. "
8,Yarn and Glue (2003),Sprout and the Bean,"I slept all day I woke with distasteand I railed, and I raved That the difference betweenthe sprout and the beanit is a golden ring, it is a twisted string. You can ask the councillor; and you can ask the king; and they'll say the same thing; and it's a funny thing: Should we go outside? Should we go outside? Should we break some bread? Are y'interested? And as I said, I slept as though deaddreaming seamless dreams of lead. When you go away, I am big-boned and feyin the dust of the day, and in the dirt of the day. And the Danger! Danger! Drawing near them was a broad boat, and Danger! Danger! Drawing near them was a white coat, And the water! water! Running clear beneath a white throat, and the hollow chatterof the talking of the tadpoles, who know th'outside! Should we go outside? Do you know th'outside? Should we go outside? "
9,Yarn and Glue (2003),This Side of the Blue,"Svetlana sucks lemons across from me, and I am progressing abominably. And I do not know my own way to the seabut the saltiest sea knows its own way to me. And the city that turns, turns protracted and slowand I find myself toeing th'Embarcaderoand I find myself knowingthe things that I knewwhich is all that you can knowon this side of the blue. And Jaime has eyesblack and shiny as bootsand they march at you two-by-two(re-loo re-loo); when she looks at you, you know she's nowhere near through: it's the kindest heart beatingthis side of the blue. And Gabriel stands beneath forest and moon. See them rattle & boo, see them shake, see them loom. See him fashion a cap from a page of Camus; see him navigate deftly this side of the blue. And the signifieds butt headswith the signifiers, and we all fall down slack-jawedto marvel at words! When across the sky sheet theimpossible birds, in a steady, illiterate movement homewards. And the rest of our liveswill the moments accruewhen the shape of their gonenesswill flare up anew. Then we do what we have to do(re-loo re-loo), which is all that you can doon this side of the blue. It's all that you can doon this side of the blue. "
10,Yarn and Glue (2003),Yarn and Glue,"Do you know what this is son? This is the panopticon And all around us blink the brash And shifty eyes of common cash So do we die or do we travel? Down the path by which one dabbles In the arts of antediluvian crafts With yarn and glue So gather twilight to your breast And couch the rabble-rouser's nest And we will take a day of rest And we will all be heaven-blessed And we will gather 'round to dine And pass the time with wicked rhymes And toast in dandelion wines To hear their mellifluous chimes We toast the fallow furrows that we sow We toast the monies that we owe, oh, oh We toast the creditors we daily face Who topple down with gruesome grace And we toast the aristocrats with blood of blue Because we know our collars are that color, too And we toast the artisans of antediluvian crafts With yarn and glue We do, we do! "
11,Yarn and Glue (2003),What We Have Known,"The tadpole buoyant as basalt The seahorse horsing in assault The owlet in his greenery The narwhal in his cup of sea They all believe They all believe But collusion bleeds through back alleys From parapets that end on feet When one is weak they discretely meet They throw the bones into the street And they progress And we retreat And all the books our fathers wrote Are in the middle of the road Little by little, we implode History brittle, brown and broke We can't remember what was spoke So we stare in wonder at the smoke What it begets is born alone We know not now what we have known Ladies, breathe deep against your whalebones For your children come home made of stone The terror seething sees a way Or like the wheezing of the bay In miniature agonies They travel westward on the breeze Bring us all to our knees The dappled horse, the sorrel mare With eyes that do not see but stare Beneath boots as black as malachite He drives the nag into the night Into the night And all the baby boys we've born With eyes averted from the storm Sent off to die in perfect form We know not now what we have known Satellite photos, rhetoric See how the euphemisms stick And when they come back broke and burned Those who return have no return"
12,Yarn and Glue (2003),Bridges and Balloons,"We sailed away on a winter's daywith fate as malleable as clay; but ships are fallible, I say, and the nautical, like all things, fades. And I can recall our caravel: a little wicker beetle shellwith four fine masts and lateen sails, its bearings on Cair Paravel. O my love, O it was a funny little thingto be the ones to've seen. The sight of bridges and balloonsmakes calm canaries irritable; and they caw and claw all afternoon: ""Catenaries and dirigiblesbrace and buoy the living-room —a loom of metals, warp-woof-wimble. ""A thimblesworth of milky mooncan touch hearts larger than a thimble. O my love, O it was a funny little thingto be the ones to've seen. O my love, O it was a funny little thing, it was a funny funny little thing. "

16,The Milk-Eyed Mender (2004),Sadie,"Sadie, white coat, you carry me home. And bury this bone, and take this pine-cone. Bury this bone to gnaw on it later; gnawing on the telephone, and'Till then, we pray & suspendthe notion that these lives do never end. And all day long we talk about mercy: lead me to water lord, I sure am thirsty Down in the ditch where I nearly served youup in the clouds where he almost heard you And all that we builtand all that we breathed, and all that we spilt, or pulled up like weedsis piled up in back; and it burns irrevocably. (and we spoke up in turns, 'till the silence crept over me)And bless you and I deeply dono longer resolute, and I call to you But the water got so cold, and you do losewhat you don't hold. This is an old song, these are old blues. This is not my tune, but it's mine to use. And the seabirds where the fear once grewwill flock with a fury, and they will bury what'd come for you. And down where I darn with the milk-eyed menderyou and I, and a love so tender, stretched-on a hoop where I stitch-this adage: ""Bless our house and its heart so savage. ""And all that I want, and all that I need, and all that I got is scattered like seed. And all that I knew is moving away from me. (and all that I know is blowinglike tumbleweed)And the mealy wormsin the brine will burnin the salty pyre, among the fauns and ferns. And the love we hold, and the love we spurn, will never grow coldonly taciturn. And I'll tell you tomorrow. Sadie, go on home now. And bless those who sicken below; and bless us who have chosen so. And all that I gotand all that I need I tie in a knotand I lay at your feet. And I have not forgot, but a silence crept over me. (So dig up your bone, exhume your pine-cone, my Sadie)"
17,The Milk-Eyed Mender (2004),Inflammatory Writ,"Oh, where is your inflammatory writ? Your text that would incite a light, ""Be lit""? Our music deserving devotion unswerving —Cry ""Do I deserve her? "" with unflagging fervor. (Well, no we do not, if we cannot get over it)But what's it meanwhen suddenly we're spent? Tell me true! Ambition came and reared its head, and wentfar from you! Even mollusks have weddings, though solemn and leadenbut you dirge for the dead, and take no jam on your bread —just a supper of salt and a waltzthrough your empty bed. And all at once it came to me, and I wrote him hunched 'till four-thirty But that vestal light, it burns out with the nightin spite of all the time that we spend on it: on one bedraggled ghost of a sonnet! While outside, the wild boars rootwithout bending a bough underfoot —O it breaks my heart; I don't know how they do't. So don't ask me! And as for my inflammatory writ? Well, I wrote it and I was not inflamed one bit. Advice from the master derailed that disaster; He said ""Hand that pen over to me, poetaster! ""While across the great plains, keening lovely & awful, ululate the lost Great American Novels —An unlawful lot, left to stutter and freeze, floodlit. (But at least they didn't run, to their undying credit. )"

23,The Milk-Eyed Mender (2004),Three Little Babes,"There was a knight, and a lady brightand three little babes had she. She sent them away, to a far country, to learn their grammerie. They hadn't been gone but a very short time, about three months and a day, when the lark spread o'er this whole wide worldand taken those babes away. It was on a cold, cold Christmas night, when everything was still, and she saw her three little babes come runningcome running down the hill. She set them a table of bread and wine, that they might drink and eat; she spread them a bed of winding sheet, that they might sleep so sweet. ""Take it off, take it off, "" cried the eldest one; ""Take it off, take it off, "" cried she, ""For I shan't stay here, in this wicked world, when there's a better one for me.

27,Ys (2006),Emily,"The meadowlark and the chim-choo-ree and the sparrowset to the sky in a flying spree, for the sport of the pharaoh. Little while later, the Pharisees dragged a comb through the meadow. Do you remember what they called up to you and me, in our window? There is a rusty light on the pines tonight; sun pouring wine, lord, or marrow, into thebones of the birches, and the spires of the churches, jutting out from the shadows; the yoke, and the axe, and the old smokestacks, and the bale, and the barrow —and everything sloped, like it was dragged from a rope, in the mouth of the south below. We’ve seen those mountains kneeling, felten and grey. We thought our very hearts would up and melt away, from that snow in the nighttime, just going and goingand the stirring of wind chimesin the morningin the morning Helps me find my way back infrom the place where I have been —And, Emily, I saw you last night by the river. I dreamed you were skipping little stones across the surface of the water —frowning at the angle where they were lost, and slipped under forever, in a mud-cloud, mica-spangled, like the sky’d been breathing on a mirror. Anyhow, I sat by your side, by the water. You taught me the names of the stars overhead, that I wrote down in my ledger —though all I knew of the rote universe were those Pleiades, loosed in December, I promised you I’d set them to verse, so I’d always remember That the meteorite is the source of the light, And the meteor’s just what we see; And the meteoroid is a stone that’s devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee. And the meteorite’s just what causes the light, And the meteor’s how it’s perceived; And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void, that lies quiet in offering to thee. *You came and lay a cold compress upon the mess I’m in; threw the windows wide, and cried amen amen amen. The whole world stopped to hear you hollering. And you looked down, and saw, now, what was happening: The lines are fading in my kingdom(though I have never known the way to border them in); so the muddy mouths of baboons and sows, and the grouse, and the horse, and the hengrope at the gate of the looming lake that was once a tidy pen. And the mail is late, and the great estates are not lit from within. The talk in town’s becoming downright sickening. In due time we will see the far buttes lit by a flare. I’ve seen your bravery, and I will follow you there And row through the nighttime, so healthy, gone healthy all of a sudden, In search of a midwifewho can help mewho can help me, help me find my way back in. And there are worries where I’ve been. And say, say, say, in the lee of the baydon’t be bothered. Leave your troubles here, where the tugboats shear the water from the water(flanked by furrows, curling back, like a match held up to a newspaper). Emily, they’ll follow your lead by the letter. And I make this claim, and I’m not ashamed to say I knew you better. What they’ve seen is just a beam of your sun that banishes winter. Let us go! Though we know it’s a hopeless endeavor. The ties that bind, they are barbed and spined, and hold us close forever. Though there is nothing would help me come to grips witha sky that is gaping and yawning, there is a song I woke with on my lips, as you sailed your great ship towards the morning. *Come on home. The poppies are all grown knee-deep by now. Blossoms all have fallen, and the pollen ruins the plow. Peonies nod in the breeze, and while they wetly bowwith hydrocephalitic listlessness, ants mop up their brow. And everything with wings is restless, aimless, drunk and dour; butterflies and birds collide at hot, ungodly hours. And my clay-colored motherlessness rangily reclines —Come on home, now! All my bones are dolorous with vines. Pa pointed out to me, for the hundredth time tonight, the way the ladle leads to a dirt-red bullet of light. Squint skyward and listen —loving him, we move within his borders: just asterisms in the stars’ set order. We could stand for a century, staring, with our heads cocked, in the broad daylight, at this thing: Joy, landlocked in bodies that don’t keep —dumbstruck with the sweetness of being, till we don’t be. Told: take this. And eat this. Told: the meteorite is the source of the light, And the meteor’s just what we see; And the meteoroid is a stone that’s devoid of the fire that propelled it to thee. And the meteorite is just what causes the light, And the meteor’s how it’s perceived; And the meteoroid’s a bone thrown from the void that lies quiet in offering to thee. "
28,Ys (2006),Monkey & Bear,"Down in the green hay, where monkey and bear usually lay, they woke from a stable-boy’s cry. He said: “someone come quick —the horses got loose, got grass-sick —they’ll founder! Fain, they’ll die. ”What is now known by the sorrel and the roan? By the chestnut, and the bay, and the gelding grey? It is: stay by the gate that you are given. And remain in your place, for your season. And had the overfed dead but listenedto the high-fence, horse-sense, wisdom…“Did you hear that, bear? ” saidmonkey, “we’ll get out of here, fair and squarethey left the gate open wide! “So, my bride. “Here is my hand. Where is your paw? Try and understand my plan, Ursala. My heart is a furnacefull of love that's just, and earnest. Now. You know that we must unlearn thisallegiance to a life of service, and no longer answer to that heartlesshay-monger, nor be his accomplice —(the charlatan, with artless hustling! )But Ursala, we’ve got to eat something, and earn our keep, while still withinthe borders of the land that man has girded, (all double-bolted and tightfisted! ), until we reach the open country, a-steeped in milk and honey. Will you keep your fancy clothes on, for me? Can you bear a little longer to wear that leash? “My love, I swear by the air I breathe: Sooner or later, you’ll bare your teeth. “But for now, just dance, darling. C’mon, will you dance, my darling? Darling, there’s a place for us; can we go, before I turn to dust? My darling there’s a place for us. “Darling. C’mon will you dance, My darling? The hills are groaning with excess, like a table ceaselessly being set. My darling we will get there yet. ”They trooped past the guards, past the coops, and the fields, and thefarmyards, all night, till finally, the space they gainedgrew much farther thanthe stone that bear threw, to mark where they’d stop for tea. But, “Walk a little faster, don’t look backwards —“your feast is to the East, which lies a little past the pasture. “When the blackbirds hear tea whistling they rise and clap. Their applause caws the kettle black. And we can’t have none of that! Move along, Bear; there, there; that’s that. ”(Though cast in plaster, our Ursala’s heart beat fasterthan monkey’s ever will. )But still, they have got to pay the bills. Hadn’t they? That is what the monkey'd say. So, with the courage of a clown, or a cur, or a kite, jerking tight at its tether, in her dun-brown gown of fur, and her jerkin ofswansdown and leather, Bear would sway on her hind legs; the organ would grind dregs of song, for the pleasureof the children who’d shriek, throwing coins at her feet, then recoiling in terror. Sing, “dance, darling. C’mon, will you dance, my darling? Darling, there’s a place for us; can we go, before I turn to dust? My darling there’s a place for us. “Darling. C’mon, will you dance, my darling? You keep your eyes fixed on the highest hill, where you’ll ever-after eat your fill. O my darling…dear…mine…if you dance, dance darling and I'll love you still. ”*Deep in the nightshone a weak and miserly light, where the monkey shouldered his lamp. Someone had told him thebear’d been wandering a fair piece awayfrom where they were camped. Someone had told himthe bear had been sneaking away, to the seaside caverns, to bathe; and the thought troubled the monkey, for he was afraid of spelunkingdown in those caves. Also afraid what thevillage people would say, if they saw the bear in that state —lolling and splashing obscenelywell, it seemed irrational, really, washing that face; washing that matted and flea-bit peltin some sea-spit-shine —old kelp dripping with brine. But monkey just laughed, and he muttered, “When she comes back, Ursala will be bursting with pride —till I jump up! Saying, ‘You’ve been rolling in muck! Saying, ‘You smell of garbage and grime! ’”But far out, far out, by now, by now —far out, by now, Bear ploughed, Because she would Not drown: First the outside-legs of the bearup and fell down, in the water, like knobby garters, Then the outside-arms of the bearfell off, as easy as if sloughedfrom boiled tomatoes. Low’red in a genteel curtsy, bear shed the mantle of herdiluvian shoulders; and, with a sigh, she allowed the burden of belly to drop, like an apronfull of boulders. If you could hold up herthreadbare coat to the light, where it’s worn translucent in places, you’d see spots where, almost every night of the year, Bear had been mending, suspending that baseness. Now her coat drags through the water, bagging, with a life’s-worth of hunger, limitless minnows; in the magnetic embrace, balletic and glacial, of bear’s insatiable shadow —Left there! Left there! When bear Left bear; Left there, Left there, When bearstepped clear of bear. (Sooner or later you'll bury your teeth)"
29,Ys (2006),Sawdust & Diamonds,"From the top of the flightof the wide, white stairs, through the rest of my life, do you wait for me there? There’s a bell in my ears. There’s the wide, white roar. Drop a bell down the stairs. Hear it fall forevermore. Hear it fall forevermore. Drop a bell off of the dock. Blot it out in the sea. Drowning mute as a rock; and sounding mutiny. There’s a light in the wings, hits the system of strings, from the side, where they swing —see the wires, the wires, the wires. And the articulation in our elbows and kneesmakes us buckle; and we couple in endless increaseas the audience admires. And the little white dove, made with love, made with love; made with glue, and a glove, and some pliersswings a low sickle arc, from its perch in the dark: settle down, settle down, my desire. And the moment I slept, I was swept up in a terrible tremor. Though no longer bereft, how I shook! And I couldn’t remember. And then the furthermost shake drove a murthering stake in, and cleft me right down through my center. And I shouldn’t say so, but I know that it was then, or never. Push me back into a tree. Bind my buttons with salt. Fill my long ears with beespraying please please please loveyou ought not No you ought not And then the system of strings tugs on the tip of my wings(cut from cardboard and old magazines): makes me warble and rise, like a sparrow. And in the place where I stood, there is a circle of wood —a cord or two — which you chop, and you stack in your barrow. It is terribly good to carry water and chop wood, streaked with soot, heavy-booted and wild-eyed; as I crash through the rafters, and the ropes and the pulleys trail afterand the holiest belfry burns sky-high. And then the slow lip of fire moves across the prairie with precision, while, somewhere, with your pliers and glue, you make your first incision. And in a moment of almost-unbearable vision, doubled over with the hunger of lions, Hold me close, cooed the dove, who was stuffed, now, with sawdust and diamonds. I wanted to say: Why the long face. Sparrow, perch and play songs of long face. Burro, buck and bray songs of long face! Sing, I will swallow your sadness, and eat your cold clay, just to lift your long face; And though it may be madness, I will take to the graveyour precious longface. And though our bones they may break, and our souls separate —Why the long face? And though our bodies recoil from the grip of the soil —Why the long face? And in the trough of the waves, which are pawing like dogs, pitch we, pale-faced and grave, as I write in my log. Then I hear a noise from the hull, seven days out to sea. And it is the damnable bell! And it tolls — well, I believe that it tolls — it tolls for me. And it tolls for me. And though my wrists and my waist seemed so easy to break, still, my dear, I’d have walked you to the edge of the water. And they will recognize all the lines of your facein the face of the daughter of the daughter of my daughter. And darling, we will be fine; but what was yours and mineappears to me a sandcastlethat the gibbering wave takes. But if it’s all just the same, then will you say my name; say my name in the morning, so that I know when the wave breaks. I wasn’t born of a whistle, or milked from a thistle at twilight. No; I was all horns and thorns, sprung out fully formed, knock-kneed and upright. So: enough of this terror. We deserve to know light, and grow evermore lighter and lighter. You would have seen me through, But I could not undo that desire. O, desire! O, desire! O, desire! Desire, desire, desire, desire. From the top of the flightof the wide, white stairs Through the rest of my life Do you wait for me there? "
30,Ys (2006),Only Skin,"And there was a booming above you, that night black airplanes flew over the sea. And they were lowing and shifting likebeached whales, shelled snails, as you strained and you squinted to seethe retreat of their hairless and blind cavalry. You froze in your sand shoal, prayed for your poor soul; sky was a bread roll, soaking in a milk-bowl. And when the bread broke —fell in bricks of wet smoke —my sleeping heart woke, and my waking heart spoke. Then there was a silence you took to mean something: Run, sing, for alive you will evermore be. And the plague of the greasy black engines a-skulkinghas gone east, while you’re left to explain them to me —releasedfrom their hairless and blind cavalry. With your hands in your pockets, stubbily runningto where I’m unfresh, undressed and yawning —Well, what is this craziness? This crazy talking? You caught some small deathwhen you were sleepwalking. It was a dark dream, darlin; it’s over. The firebreather is beneath the clover. Beneath his breathing there is cold clay, forever: a toothless hound-dog choking on a feather. But I took my fishing pole (fearing your fever), down to the swimming hole, where there grows a bitter herbthat blooms but one day a year, by the riverside —I’d bring it here: Apply it gentlyto the love you’ve lent me. While the river was twisting and braiding, the bait bobbedand the string sobbed, as it cut through the hustling breeze. And I watched how the water was kneading so neatly, gone treacly, nearly slowed to a stop in this heat; in a frenzy coiling flush along the muscles beneath. Press on me, we are restless things. Webs of seaweed are swaddling. And you call upon the dusk of themusk of a squid: shot full of ink, until you sink into your crib. Rowing along, among the reeds, among the rushes, I heard your song, before my heart had time to hush it! Smell of a stonefruit being cut and being opened. Smell of a low and of a lazy cinder smoking And when the fire moves away, fire moves away, son. Why would you say I was the last one? Scrape your knee: it is only skin. Makes the sound of violins. And when I cut your hair, and leave the birds all of the trimmings, I am the happiest woman among all women. And the shallow water stretches as far as I can see. Knee deep, trudging along —the seagull weeps ‘so long’ —humming a threshing song —Until the night is over, hold on, hold on; hold your horses back from the fickle dawn. I have got some business out at the edge of town, candy weighing both of my pockets downtill I can hardly stay afloat, from the weight of them(and knowing how the commonfolk condemnwhat it is I do, to you, to keep you warm: Being a woman. Being a woman. )But always up the mountainside you’re clambering, groping blindly, hungry for anything; picking through your pocket linings —well, what is this? Scrap of sassafras, eh Sisyphus? I see the blossoms broke and wet after the rain. Little sister, he will be back again. I have washed a thousand spiders down the drain. Spiders’ ghosts hang, soaked anddangling silently, from all the blooming cherry trees, in tiny nooses, safe from everyone —nothing but a nuisance; gone now, dead and done —Be a woman. Be a woman. Though we felt the spray of the waves, we decided to stay, 'till the tide rose too far. We weren’t afraid, cause we know what you are; and you know that we know what you are. Awful atoll —O, incalculable indiscreetness and sorrow! Bawl bellow: Sibyl sea-cow, all done up in a bow. Toddle and roll; teethe an impalpable bit of leather, while yarrow, heather and hollyhockawkwardly molt along the shore. Are you mine? My heart? Mine anymore? Stay with me for awhile. That’s an awfully real gun. I know life will lay you down, as the lightning has lately done. Failing this, failing this, follow me, my sweetest friend, to see what you anointed, in pointing your gun there. Lay it down! Nice and slow! There is nowhere to go, save up; up where the light, undiluted, isweaving, in a drunk dream, at the sight of my baby, out back: back on the patio, watching the bats bring night in— while, elsewhere, estuaries of wax-whitewend, endlessly, towards seashores unmapped. *Last week, our picture windowproduced a half-word, heavy and hollow, hit by a brown bird. We stood and watched her gape like a rattlesnakeand pant and labor over every intake. I said a sort of prayer for some rare grace, then thought I ought to take her to a higher place. Said, “dog nor vulture nor cat shall toy with you, and though you die, bird, you will have a fine view. ”Then in my hot hand, she slumped her sick weight. We tramped through the poison oak, heartbroke and inchoate. The dogs were snapping, and you cuffed their collarswhile I climbed the tree-house. Then how I hollered! Well she’d lain, as still as a stone, in my palm, for a lifetime or two; then saw the treetops, cocked her head, and up and flew. (While back in the world that moves, often, according tothe hoarding of these clues, dogs still run roughly aroundlittle tufts of finch-down. )And the cities we passed were a flickering wasteland, but his hand, in my hand, made them hale and harmless. While down in the lowlands, the crops are all coming; we have everything. Life is thundering blissful towards deathin a stampedeof his fumbling green gentleness. You stopped by; I was all alive. In my doorway, we shucked and jived. And when you wept, I was gone; see, I got gone when I got wise. But I can’t with certainty say we survived. Then down and downand down and downand down and deeper, stoke, without sound, the blameless flames, you endless sleeper. Through fire below, and fire above, and fire within, sleep through the things that couldn’t have been, if you hadn’t have been. And when the fire moves away, fire moves away, son. And why would you say I was the last one? All my bones, they are gone, gone, gone. Take my bones, I don’t need none. Cold, cold cupboard, lord, nothing to chew on! Suck all day on a cherry stone. Dig a little hole not three inches round —Spit your pit in a hole in the ground. Weep upon the spot for the starving of me! Till up grows a fine young cherry tree. When the bough breaks, what’ll you make for me? A little willow cabin to rest on your knee. Well, what will I do with a trinket such as this? Think of your woman, who’s gone to the west. But I’m starving and freezing in my measly old bed! Then I’ll crawl across the salt flats, to stroke your sweet head. Come across the desert with no shoes on! I love you truly, or I love no-one. Fire moves away. Fire moves away, son. Why would you say that I was the last one? Last one? Clear the room! There’s a fire, a fire, a fire. Get going, and I’m going to be right behind you. And if the love of a woman or two, dear, could move you to such heights, then all I can dois do, my darling, right by you. "

32,Joanna Newsom and the Ys Street Band (2007),Colleen,"I tell it as I best know how, And that's the way it was told to me: Must have once been a thief or a whore, Then surely was thrown overboard, Where, they say, I came their way from the deep blue sea. It picked me up and tossed me round. I lost my shoes and tore my gown. Forgot my name, And drowned. Then woke up with the surf a-pounding; It seemed I had been run aground. Well they took me in and shod my feet And taught me prayers for chastity And said my name would be Colleen, and I was blessed among all women, To have forgotten everything. And as the weeks and months ensued I tried to make myself of use. Tilled and planted, but could not produce —not root, nor leaf, nor flower, nor bean; Lord! It seemed I overwatered everything. And I hate the sight of that empty air, like stepping for a missing stairand falling forth forever blindly: cannot grab hold of anything! No, Not I, most blessed among Colleens. *I dream some nights of a funny sea, as soft as a newly born baby. It cries for me so pitifully! And I dive for my child with a wildness in me, and am so sweetly there received.

""This morning, 'round the cape at dawn, some travellers sailed into townwith scraps for sale and the saddest songsand a book of pictures, leather-bound, thatshowed a whale with a tusk a meter long.

He said, ""My lady looks perturbed. (the light is in your eyes, Colleen). ""I said, ""Whatever can you mean? ""He leaned in and said, ""You ain't forgotten everything.

I would not speak your name in this place; and if I were to try then the wind — I swear —would rise, to tear you clean from me without atrace. """"Have you come, then, to rescue me? ""He laughed and said, ""from what, 'colleen'? ""You dried and dressed most willingly. you corseted, and caught the dread diseaseby which one comes to know such peace. ""Well, it's true that I came to know such things asthe laws that govern propertyand the herbs to feed the babes that wean, and the welting weight for every season; but still I don't know any goddamned ""Colleen.

35,Have One on Me (2010),Easy,"Easy, easy. My man and me, we could rest and remain here, easily. We are tested and painedby what's beyond our bed. We are blessed and sustainedby what is not said. No-one knows what is coming, orwho will harvest what we have sown, or how I've been dulling, and dumbing, in the service of the heart alone, or how I am worn to the boneby the river, and, in the river made of light, I'm your little life-giver. I will give my life. Haven't you seen what I've seen? Don't you know what you ought to do? I was born to love, and I intend to love you. Down in the valley, where the fields are green, Watch my luck turn, fro and to; pluck every last daisy clean, till only I may love you. I am easy, easy to keep. Honey, you please meeven in your sleep. But my arms want to carry. My heart wants to hold. Tell me your worries. I want to be told. Sit, and see how the fog, from the port in the bay, lays like snowat the foot of the roanoke; hear the frog, going courting, till the day he croaks, saying, even then, How there is light in the river. And there's a river made of light. C'mon, you little life-giver. Give your life. Who asked you? Asked youif you want to be loved by me? Who died, and made you in chargeof who loves who? All the livelong day, if I have my way, I will love you. But One can't carry the weight, or change the fate, of Two. I've been waiting for a break. How long's it gonna take? Let me love you. How about it? How about what I have to say? How about that livelong day? How am I gonna stay herewithout you? Easy, easy. You must not fear. You must meet me, to see me. I am barely here.

I called to you, several times, while the change took placeand then arrived, all night, and I died. But all these songs, when you and I are long gone, will carry on. Mud in your eye. You asked my hand, hired a band. ""In your heart is all that you need; ask and you will receive, "" it is said. I threw my bouquet, and I knocked 'em dead. Bottle of white, bottle of red. Helpless as a child, when you held me in your arms, and I knew that no othercould ever love me as you loved. Love me as you loved. But help me! I'm leaving! I remember everything, down to the sound of you shaving —the scrape of your razor, the dully-abrading black hairthat remainedwhen you clutched at me, that night I came upstairs, half-dead, and, in your kindness, you put me straightawayin the cupboard, with a bottle of champagne, and then, later, on a train. It was dark out, I was half-dead. I saw a star fall into the sky, like a chunk of thrown coal, as if god himself spatlike a cornered rat. I really want you to do this for me, will you have one on me? It was dark; I was drunk and half-dead, and we slept, knocking heads, sitting up in the star-smoking air, knocking heads like buoys. Don't you worry for me! Will you have one on me! Meanwhile, I will raise my own glassto how you made me fastand expendable, and I will drink to your excellent health, and your cruelty. Will you have one on me? — helpless as a child, when you held me in your arms, and I knew that no othercould ever love me —From the courtyard, I floated inand watched it go down. Heard the cup drop; thought, ""Well, that's whythey keep them around. ""The blackguard sat hard, down, with no head on him now, and I felt so bad, cause I didn't know howto feel bad enoughto make him proud. Well daddy longlegs, are you? Daddy longlegs, are you? Daddy longlegs, are you proud? "
37,Have One on Me (2010),'81,"I found a little plot of land, in the garden of Eden. It was dirt, and dirt is all the same. I tilled it with my two hands, and I called it my very own; there was no-one to dispute my claim. Well, you'd be shockedat the state of things —the whole placehad just cleared right out. It was hotter'n hell, so I laid me by a spring, for a spell, as naked as a trout. The wandering eye that I have caughtis as hot as a wandering sun. But I will want for nothing more, in my garden: start again, in my hardening to every heart but one. Meet me in the garden of Eden. Bring a friend. We are gonna have ourselves a time. We are gonna have a garden party. It's on me! No, sirree, it's my dime. We broke our hearts, in the war between St. George and the dragon, but both, in equal parts, are welcome to come along. I'm inviting everyone. Farewell to loves that I have known, Even muddiest waters run. Tell me, what is meant by sin, or none, in a gardenseceded from the unionin the year of A. D. 1? The unending amends you've madeare enough for one life. Be done. I believe in innocence, little darling. Start again. I believe in everyone. I believe, regardless. I believe in everyone. "
38,Have One on Me (2010),Good Intentions Paving Company,"Twenty miles left to the show. Hello, my old country. Hello. Stars are just beginning to appear, and I have never, in my life, before been here. And it's my heart, not me, who cannot drive, at which conclusion you arrived, watching me sit here, bolt upright, and cry for no good reasonat the Eastering sky. And the tilt of this strange nation, and the will to remain for the duration(waving the flag, feeling it drag). Like a bump on a bump on a log, baby; like I'm in a fistfight with the fog, baby; step, ball-change, and a-pirouette! And I regret, I regrethow I said to you, Honey, just open your heart, when I've got troubleeven opening a honey jar. And that, right there, is where we are. And I've been 'fessing, double-fast, addressing questions nobody asked. I'll get this joy off of my chest, at last, and I will love youtill the noise has long since passed. And I did not mean to shout, Just drive, Just get us out, dead or alive. The road's too long to mention —Lord, it's something to see! —laid down by the Good Intentions Paving Company, all the way to the thingwe've been playing at, darling. I can see that you're wearingyour staying-hat, darling. And for the time being, all is well. Won't you love me a spell? This is blindness, beyond all conceiving, while behind us, the road is leaving, and leaving, and falling backlike a rope gone slack. And, I saw straightawaythat the lay was steep, but I fell for you, honey, easy as falling asleep. And that, right there, is the course I keep. And no amount of talkingis going to soften the fall, but, like after the rain, step out of the overhang. That's all. It had a nice ring to it, when the old opry house rang, so, with a solemn auld langsyne, sealed, delivered, I sang. And there is hesitation, and it always remains(concerning you, me, and the rest of the gang), and, in our quiet hour, I feel I see everything, and am in lovewith the hookupon which everyone hangs. And I know you meantto show the extentto which you gave a goddang —you ranged real hot and real cold, but I'm sold, I am at home on that range. And I do hate to fold, right here, at the top of my game, when I've been tryingwith my whole heart and soulto stay right here, in the right lane. But it can make you feel over, and old(Lord, you know it's a shame), when I only want for you to pull over, and hold me, till I can't remember my own name. "
39,Have One on Me (2010),No Provenance,"Allelu, allelu: I have died happy, and lived to tell the tale to you. I have slept for forty years, and woke to find me gone. I woke safe and warm in your arms. In your arms, your arms, in your arms. Not informed of the natural law, squatting, lordly, on a stool, in a stall, we spun gold clear out of straw. And, when our bales of bullionwere stored, you burned me like a barn. I burned safe and warm in your arms. In your arms, your arms. I'm afraid of the Big Return. There's a certain conversation lost, and that loss incurredwith nobody remaining, to register who had passed this way, in the night, in the middle of the night(negating their grace and their sight), till only I remember, or mark, how we had our talk: We took our ride, so that there was no-one home, and the lights of Romeflickered and died. And, what's more, I believe that you knew it, too; I think you saw their flares, and kept me safely unawares, in your arms. Your arms, in your arms. The grass was tall, and strung with burrs, I essayed that high sashay which, in my mind, was my way; you hung behind, in yours. Anyhow, she did not neigh. I do not knowwhat drew our eyes to hers; that little black mare did not stir, till I lay down in your arms. Poor old dirty little dog-size horse! —swaying and wheezing, as a matter of course; swaying and wheezing, as a matter of pride. That poor old nag, not four palms wide, had waited a long time, coated in salt, buckled like a ship run foul of the fence. And in the middle of the night, she'd sprung up, no provenance, bearing the whites of her eyes. And you, with your'arrangement' with Fate, nodded sadly at her lame assaulton that steady old gate, her faultlessly etiolated fishbelly-face; the muzzle of a ghost. And, pretty Johnny Appleseed, via satellite feed, tell us, who was itthat you then loved the most? Pretty Johnny Appleseed, leave a trail that leadsstraight back down to the farm. Lay me downsafe and warm in your arms. In your arms. "
40,Have One on Me (2010),Baby Birch,"This is the song for Baby Birch. I will never know you. And at the back of what we've done, there is that knowledge of you. Well I wish we could take every path. I could spend a hundred yearsadoring you. Yes, I wish we could take every path, because you know I hated to closethe door on you. Do you remember staring, up at the stars, so far away in their bulletproof cars? We heard the rushing, slow intakeof the dark, dark water, and the engine breaks, and I said, How about them engine breaks? And, if I should die before I wake, will you keep an eye on Baby Birch? Because I'd hate to see hermake the same mistakes. When it was dark, I called and you came. When it was dark, I saw shapes. When I see stars, I feel, in your hand, and I see stars, and I reel, again. Well mercy me. I'll be goddamned. It's been a long, long timesince I last saw you. And I have never known the plan. It's been a long, long time. How are you? Your eyes are green. Your hair is gold. Your hair is black. Your eyes are blue. I closed the ranks, and I doubled back —but, you know, I hated to closethe doggone door on you. We take a walk along the dirty lake. Hear the goose, cussing at me over her eggs. You poor little cousin. I don't want your dregs(A little baby fussing over my legs). There is a blacksmith, and there is a shepherd, and there is a butcher-boy, and there is a barber, who's cuttingand cutting away at my only joy. I saw a rabbit, as slick as a knife, and as pale as a candlestick, and I had thought it'd be harder to do, but I caught her, and skinned her quick: held her there, kicking and mewling, upended, unspooling, unsung and blue; told her ""wherever you go, little runaway bunny, I will find you. ""And then she ran, as they're liable to do. Be at peace baby, and be gone. Be at peace baby, and be gone. "
41,,On a Good Day,"Hey hey hey, the end is near! On a good day, you can see the end from here. But I won't turn back, now, though the way is clear; I will stay for the remainder. I saw a life, and I called it mine. I saw it, drawn so sweet and fine, and I had begun to fill in all the lines, right down to what we'd name her. Our nature does not change by will. In the winter, 'round the ruined mill, the creek is lying, flat and still; it is water, though it's frozen. So, 'cross the years, and miles, and through, on a good day, you can feel my love for you. Will you leave me be, so that we can stay trueto the path that you have chosen? "
42,,"You and Me, Bess","We picked our waydown to the beach, watching the wavesdragging out of our reach: tangling tails, like a sodden sheet; dangling entrailsfrom the gut of the sea. Hoarding our meals (alfalfa and rolls); trying not to catchthe cold eye of the gulls —I hope Mother Nature has notoverheard! (Though, she doles out hurtlike a puking bird. )We stayed for the winter. No-one told usabout the laws of the land. I hold my own. But you, with your hunger —you, on the other hand —make yourself known. And when we were found, I know we both grieved. My heart made the sound ofsnow falling from eaves. You and me, Bess, we was as thick as thieves. So I swore, nonetheless, up and down, it was only me. So they took me away, and, after some timestudying my case, must have made up their minds. By the time you realized I was dying, must have been too late. I believe you were not lying. It is the day. I wake, with my ears cocked up like a gun(like every day, of course), yanked by my wriststo the sugar-front courtyard —now tell me, what have I done? seems I have stolen a horse. and I step to the gallows. Who do you think that you are —arching your hooves like a crane, in the shallow gutterthat lines the boulevards, crowded with folkswho just stare as I hang? It's all the same. Kindness comes over me; what was your name? It makes no difference. I'm glad that you came. Forever, I'll listen to your glad neighing. "
43,,In California,"My heart became a drunken runton the day I sunk in this shunt, to tap me cleanof all the wonderand the sorrow I have seen, since I left my home: My home, on the old Milk Lake, where the darkness does fall so fast, it feels like some kind of mistake(just like they told you it would; just like the Tulgeywood). When I came into my land, I did not understand: neither dry rot, nor the burn pile, nor the bark-beetle, nor the dry well, nor the black bear. But there is another, who is a little older. When I broke my bone, he carried me up from the riverside. To spend my lifein spitting-distanceof the love that I have known, I must stay here, in an endless eventide. And if you come and see me, you will upset the order. You cannot come and see me, for I set myself apart. But when you come and see me, in California, you cross the border of my heart. Well, I have sown untidy furrowsacross my soul, but I am still a coward, content to see my garden growso sweet & fullof someone else's flowers. Sometimes I can almost feel the power. Sometimes I am so in love with you(like a little clockthat trembles on the edge of the hour, only ever calling out ""Cuckoo, cuckoo""). When I called you, you, little one, in a bad way, did you love me? Do you spite me? Time will tell if I can be well, and rise to meet you rightly. While, moving across my land, brandishing themselveslike a burning branch, advance the tallow-colored, walleyed deer, quiet as gondoliers, while I wait all night, for you, in California, watching the fox pick off my goldfishfrom their sorry, golden state —and I am no longerafraid of anything, savethe life that, here, awaits. I don't belong to anyone. My heart is heavy as an oil drum. I don't want to be alone. My heart is yellow as an ear of corn, and I have torn my soul apart, frompulling artlessly with fool commands. Some nights I just never go to sleep at all, and I stand, shaking in my doorway like a sentinel, all alone, bracing like the bow upon a ship, and fully abandoningany thought of anywherebut home, my home. Sometimes I can almost feel the power. And I do love you. Is it only timing, that has made it such a dark hour, only ever chiming out, ""Cuckoo, cuckoo""? My heart, I wear you down, I know. Gotta think straight, keep a clean plate; keep from wearing down. If I lose my head, just where am I going to lay it? (For it has half-ruined me, to be hanging around, here, among the daphne, blooming out of the big brown; I am native to it, but I'm overgrown. I have choked my rootson the earth, as rich as roe, here, down in California. )"
44,,Jackrabbits,"I was tired of being drunk. My face cracked like a joke. So I swung through herelike a brace of jackrabbits, with their necks all broke. I stumbled at the door with my boot, and I knocked against the jamb. and I scrabbled at your chest, like a mute, with my fists of ham. trying to tell you that I amtelling you I can —I canlove you again; love you again. I'm squinting towards the East. My faith makes me a dope. But you can take my hand, in the darkness, darling, like a length of rope. I shaped up overnight, you know, the day after she died. when I saw my heart, and I'll tell you, darling, it was open wide. what with telling you I amtelling you I can —I canlove you again; love you again. And it can have no bounds, you know. It can have no end. You can take my handin the darkness, darling, when you need a friend. And it can change in shape or form, but never change in size. Well the water, it ran deep, my darling, where it don't run wide. The feather of a hawk was bound, bound around my neck; a poultice made of fig, the eager little vultures pecked. And a verse I read in jestin Matthew, spoke to me; said There's a flame that moveslike a low-down pestand says, You will be freeonly, tell me that I cantell me that I can: I can love you again; love you again. Love you again, love you again. Love you again, love you again. Love you again, love you again. Love you again, love you again. Love you again, love you. . . "
45,,Go Long,"Last night, again, you were in my dream. Several expendable limbs were at stake. You were a prince, spinning rims, all sentiments indian-givenand half-baked. I was broughtin on a palanquinmade of the many bodiesof beautiful women. Brought to this place, to be examined, swaying on an elephant: a princess of India. We both want the very same thing. We are praying I am the one to save you. But you don't even ownyour own violence. Run away from home —your beard is still bluewith the loneliness of you mighty men, with your jaws, and fists, and guitars, and pens, and your sugarlip, but I've never been to the firepitswith you mighty men. Who made you this way? Who made you this way? Who is going to bearyour beautiful children? Do you think you can just stop, when you're ready for a change? Who will take care of youwhen you're old and dying? You burn in the Mekong, to prove your worth. Go long! Go long! Right over the edge of the earth! You have been wronged, tore up since birth. You have done harm. Others have done worse. Will you tuck your shirt? Will you leave it loose? You are badly hurt. You're a silly goose. You are caked in mud, and in blood, and worse. Chew your bitter cud. Grope your little nurse. Do you know whymy ankles are bound in gauze? (sickly dressage: a princess of Kentucky)? In the middle of the woods(which were the probable cause), we danced in the lodgelike two panting monkeys. I will give you a call, for one last hurrah. And if this tale is tall, forgive my scrambling. But you keep palming along the wall, moving at a blind crawl, but always rambling. Wolf-spider, crouch in your funnel nest. If I knew you, once, now I know you less. In the sinking sand, where we've come to rest, have I had a hand in your loneliness? When you leave me alonein this old palace of yours, it starts to get to me. I take to walking. What a woman does is open doors. And it is not a question of lockingor unlocking. Well, I have never seensuch a terrible room —gilded with the gold teethof the women who loved you! Now, though I die, Magpie, this I bequeath: by any other name, a Jay is still bluewith the lonelinessof you mighty men, with your mighty kissthat might never never end, while, so far away, in the seat of the West, burns the fountof the heatof that loneliness. There's a manwho only will speak in code, backing slowly, slowly down the road. May he master everythingthat such men may knowabout loving, and then letting go. "
46,,Occident,"Mercy me, the night is long. Take my pen, to write you this song. Lord: is it harder to carry on, or to know when you are done? All my life, I've felt as though I'm inside a beautiful memory, replayingwith the sound turned down low. Long-life, show your face. Slow-heart, curb your taste. Smoke me out of my hiding place. Long-life, state your case. What in the world are we waiting for —building glowing cities along the shore, where the wind batters in, baiting my kin like a matador? So much value, placed uponwhat lies just beyond our plans: waving my handkerchief, running along, till the end of the sand. Long-life, speak your name. So tired of the guessing game. But, something is moving, just out of frame: Slow-heart, brace and aim. Breaching slowly, across the sea, one mast —a flash, like the stinger of a bee —to take you away, a swarming fleet is gonna take youfrom me. The universe is getting loose: sodden spread, from some leaden disuse, rushing, unhinged, toward diminishing lights, like a headless caboose. I'll wait for you, alongside the ocean, and make dowith my no-skin. But then, Long-life, will you let me in? And then, Slow-heart, are you gonna know him? Long-life, speak your name. I wait, while I decry the wait. And when I die, may I relate: Slow heart, congregate. To leave your home, and your family, for some distortion of property? Well, darling, I can't go. But you may stayhere, with me. "
47,,Soft as Chalk,"So, so long ago, and so far away, when Time was just a linethat you fed me, when you wanted to stay, we'd talkas soft as chalk, till morning came, pale as a pearl: No time! No time! Now, I have got all the timein the world. Say, honey, did you belong to me? Tell me, honey, was your heart at rest when, darlin, all the mourning doves were howling usa song of love'sgodawful lawlessness? Lawlessness. Say, honey, did you belong to me? Tell me, honey, did I pass your test? I lay, as still as death, until the dawn, whereupon I wrested fromyour godawful lawlessness. Lawlessness. I roam around the tidy groundsof my dappled sanatorium. Coatless, I sitamongst the motes, adrift, and I dote upon my pinesap gum. And the light, through the pines, in brassy tines, lays over me, dim as rumand thick as molasses. And so time passes. And so, my heart, tomorrow comes. I feel you, leaning, out back with the crickets, loyal heart marking the soon-ness, darkness: tonight, still, the mourning doveswill summon us their songof love's neverdoneing lawlessness, lawlessnesswhile, over and over —rear up! stand down! lay round! —trying to sound-out, or guess the reasons, I sleep like a soldier, without rest. But there is no treason, where there is only lawlessness. Lawlessness. In the last weekof the last year I was aware, I took a blind shot, across the creek, at the black bear, when he roused me in the night, and left me cowering with my light, calling out Who is there? Who's there? Who is there? I watched you sleep, repeating my prayer. (You give love a little shoveand it becomes terror. )And now I am calling, in a sadness beyond angerand beyond fear, Who is there? Who's there? Who is there? I glare and nod, like the character, God, bearing downupon the houses and lawns. I knew a little bit, but, darling, you were it, and, darling, now it is long gone. Sweetheart, in your clean, bright start —back there, behind a hill, and a dell, and a state line or two —I'll be thinking of you. Yes, I'll be thinking, and be wishing you well. We land, I stand, But I wait for the sound of the bell. I have to catch a cab, and my bags are at the carousel. And then — Lord, just then —time alone will only tell. You mourning dove. "
48,,Esme,"I can feel a difference. Today, a difference: all of us, in our tents, fearing god like a mistress. We lay on the rocks, in the sun, watching you and your mama row in, I sat up and blinked, when you appeared, so pale you were nearly clear! Later, I stumbled to my bed, all alone in the branches. I laid in the dark, thinking about all of my friends, and their changes. And I do not knowif you know just what you have done. You are the sweetest one I have ever laid my eyes upon. It's a beautiful town, with the rain coming down. Blackberry, rosemary, jimmy-crack-corn. You've got the run of the place, now that you're running around; and may kindness, kindness, kindness abound. In this hour of our lives —hour of effortless plenty —how do we knowwhich parts of our hearts want what, with such base generosity? Taking so many photographs —so amazed! —we've never seen a baby so newlyborn. And, when the bulbs do flash, as bright as morning, the crowd keeps on gatheringlike an electric storm. The phantom of lovemoves among us at will. Each phantom-limb lost, has got an angel(so confused, like the wagging bobbed-tailof a bulldog): kindness, kindness prevails. Kindness prevails! Ties and rails, ties and rails fall into line, bearing kindness. Where will you go, if not here? What will you say, when you write to us? And this is a world of terrible hardship, everywhere, and I search for wordsto set you at ease. But there, in the looking-glass, a kite is soaring, stilling my warring heartand my trembling knees. Clean as a breeze, bright as the day: all of the people gather to say: ""Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme! Oh, oh, oh! ""I believe love will always surround you —brave as a bear, with a heart rare and true. But if you are scared, if you are blue, I have prepared this small song for you: Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme! Oh, oh, oh! Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme! Oh, oh, oh! Sweet Esme! Esme! Sweet Esme! Sweet Esme! Oh, oh, oh! "
49,,Autumn,"Driven through by her own sword, summer died last night, alone. Even the ghostshuddled up for warmth. Autumn has come to my hometown. Friendly voices, dead and gone, singing, Star of the country down. . . (even the ghosts help raise the barn, here, now, in my hometown)— when, out of the massingthat bodes and bides, in the cold west, flew a waxwing, who frozeand died against my breast! And all the while, rain, like a weed in the tide, swans and lists, downon the gossiping lawns, saying tsk tsk tsk. I may have changed. It's hard to gauge. Time won't account for how I've aged. Would I could tie your lying tongue, who says that leaving keeps you young. And I have got no controlover my heart, over my mind. Over the hills, the rainclouds roll. I'll winter here, wait for a signto cast myselfout, over the water, riven like a wishbone. You'd hardly guess I was my own mother's daughter; I ain't naturally given to roam. And I lay low, when I return, and I movelike a gurneywhose wheels are squeaking, alone, here in my home, and I laugh, when you speak of mypleasure-seekingamong the tall pines, along the lay-lines. Here, where the loon keens. There, where the moon leans. There, where I know my violent love lays down, in a row of silent, dove-gray days. Here, in a row of silent, dove-gray days. Wherever I go, I am snowboundby thoughts of himwhom I would shun. I loved them all, one by one. Cannot gain ground, cannot outrun; but time marches along. You can't always stick around. But, when the final count is done, I will be in my hometown. I will be in my hometown. "
50,,Ribbon Bows,"There is a spring, not far from here, The water runs both sweet and clear —both sweet and clear, and cold: could crack your boneswith veins of gold. I stood, a-wagging, at the tap; just a-waiting on the lagging, rising sap. I held the cold tin ladle to my lip. At the Shrine of the Thousand Arms, I lowered my eyes to sip. What a beautiful day to catch my drift, or be caught up in it. You want your love, Love? Come and get your love; I only took it backbecause I thought you didn't. How my ears did ring, at the municipal pound, from that old hangdogto which I was bound: curled 'round the bottom rung —doesn't nobody want you? Well, come on, darlin. I could use someone like you around. I am not like you, I ain't from this place. And I do reserve the rightto repeat all my same mistakes. And, in the night, like you, I certainly bite and chewwhat I can find, and never seem to lose the taste. What a horrible face I feel me make —For Pete's sake, what you have told me, I cannot erase! —(Though I keep on saying, and I do believe, it is not too late). All day, you're hassling me with trifles: black nose of the dog, as cold as a rifle, indicating, with a nudge, God, No God. God, No God. Sweet, appraising eye of the dog, blink once if god, twice if no god. My mama may be ashamed of me, with all of my finery: carrying on, whooping it up till the early morn, lost and lorn, among the madding revelry! Sure, I can pass. Honey, I can pass. Particularly when I start to tip my glass. I'll be a sport, and have a go at that old song, singing unabashed, about'Them city girls, with their ribbon bows, and their fancy sash. . . 'But, though I get so sad(could swear the nightmakes a motion to claim me, around that second verse), I reckon I've felt worse, and still held fast. But, later on, when I am alone, alone at last, well I take my god to task. I take my daggone god to task. "
51,,Kingfisher,"Whose is the hand that I will hold? Whose is the face I will see? Whose is the name that I will call, when I am called to meet thee? In this life, who did you love, beneath the drifting ashes, beneath the sheeting banks of airthat barrenly bore our rations? When I could speak, it was too late. Didn't you hear me calling? Didn't you see my heart leap, like a pup in the constant barley? In this life, where did you crouch, when the sky had set to boiling? Burning within, seen from without, and your gut was a serpent, coiling. And, for the sake of that pit of snakes, for whom did you allay your shyness, and spend all your mercy, and madness, and grace, in a day, beneath the bending cypress? It was not on principal. Show, Pro-heart, that you have got gall. A miracle: I can bear a lot, but not that pall. I can bear a lot, but not that pall! Kingfisher, sound the alarm. Say, ""Sweet little darlin, now, come to my arms; tell me all about the loveyou left on the farm. ""He was a kind, unhurried manwith a heavy lip and a steady hand, but he loved me just like a little child; like a little child loves a little lamb. Thrown to the ground, by something down there; bitten by the bad air, while the clouds tick; trying to read all the signs, preparing for when the bombs hit; hung from the underbelly of the earth, while the stars skid away, below, gormless and brakeless, gravel-loose, falling silent as gavels in the snow I lay back and spit my chaw, wrapped in the long arm of the Law, who has seen it all: I can bear a lot, but not that pall. I can bear a lot, but not that pall! Kingfisher, cast your fly: oh, Lord, it happens without even trying, when I sling a low lookfrom my shuttering eye. Blows rain upon the one you loved, and, though you were only sparring, there's blood on the eye. Unlace the glove. Say, Honey I am not sorry. Stand here and namethe one you loved, beneath the drifting ashes, and, in naming, rise above time, as it, flashing, passes. We came by the boatload, and were immobilized: worshipping volcanoes, charting the loping skies. The tides of the earthleft us bound, and calcified, and made as obstinate as obsidian, unmoving, save our eyes: just mooning and blinkingfrom faces marked with coal. (Ash cooling and shrinkingcracks loud as thunder rolling. )I swear I know you. You know me. Where have we met before? Tell me true: to whose authoritydo you consign your soul? I had a dream you came to me, said You shall not do me harm anymore, and with your knife, you evicted my lifefrom its little lighthouseon the seashore. And I saw that my bloodhad no bounds, spreading in a circle like an atom bomb, soaking and fellingeverything in its path, and welling in my heart like a birdbath. It is too short —the day we are born, we commence with our dying. Trying to serve, with the heart of a child; kingfisher, lie with the lion. "
52,,Does Not Suffice,"I will pack up my pretty dresses. I will box up my high-heeled shoes. A sparkling ring, for every finger, I'll put away, and hide from view. Coats of bouclé, jacquard and cashmere; cartouche and tweed, all silver shot —and everything that could remind youof how easy I was not. I'll tuck away my gilded buttons; I'll bind my silks in shapeless bales; Wrap it all on up, in reams of tissue, and then I'll kiss you, sweet, farewell. You saw me rise to our occasion, and so deny the evidence. Caused me to burn, and twist, and grimace against you, like something caughton a barbed-wire fence. Now, you can see me fall back here, redoubled, full bewildered and amazed. I have gotten into some terrible trouble, beneath your blank and rinsing gaze. It does not sufficefor you to say I am a sweet girl, or to say you hate to see me sadbecause of you. It does not suffice, to merely lie beside each other, as those who love each other do. I picture you, rising up in the morning: stretching out on your boundless bed, beating a clear path to the shower, scouring yourself red. The tap of hangers, swaying in the closet —unburdened hooksand empty drawers —and everywhere I tried to love youis yours again, and only yours. "
53,Divers (2015),Anecdotes,"Sending the first scouts over, back from the place beyond the dawn: Horse, bear your broken soldier, eyes frozen wide at what went on. And Time, in our camp, is movingas you’d anticipate it to. But what is this sample proving? Anecdotes cannot say what Time may do. I kid with Rufous Nightjar, when our men are all asleep: ""It ain’t about how rare you are, but how hard you are to see. Take, you and me—""“When are you from? ” said he, in our blind of winter leaves, as we sighted out their fliersin the grayscale of the nightfumbled on the bare groundto bury round landmines, while the dew lay down and dried. We signal Private Poorwill, when morning starts to loom: “Pull up from your dive! ”till we hear the telltale Boom, too soon—hotdogging loon, caught therelike a shard of mirror in the moon! Now they’ve stopped giving orders, but I follow anyway, laying in our state of torpor, waiting out the daywhile the dew burns away. Rushing, tearing, speeding home: bound to a wheel that is not my own, where round every bend I long to seetemporal infidelity. And all along the road, the lights stream by. I want to go where the dew won't dry. I want to go where the light won’t bend—far as the eye may reach—nor end. But inasmuch as that light is loaned, insofar as we’ve borrowed bones, must every debt now be repaidin star-spotted, sickle-winged night raids, while we sing to the garden, and we sing to the stars, and we sing in the meantime, wherever you are? In the folds and the branches, somewhere, out there, I was only just born into open air. Now hush, little babe. You don’t want to bedown in the trenches, remembering with me, where you will not mark my leaving, and you will not hear my parting song. Nor is there cause for grieving. Nor is there cause for carrying on. —and daughter, when you are able, come down and join! The kettle's on, and your family's round the table. Will you come down, before the sun is gone? "
54,Divers (2015),Sapokanikan,"The cause is Ozymandian. The map of Sapokanikanis sanded and beveled, the land lone and leveledby some unrecorded and powerful handwhich plays along the monument, and drums, upon a plastic bag, The Brave Men and Women, So Dear to Godand Famous To All of the Ages rag. (Sing: Do you love me? Will you remember? The snow falls above me. The Renderer, renders. The Event is in the hand of God. )Beneath a Patch of Grass, her bones the old Dutch master hid, while, elsewhere, Tobias and the Angel disguisedwhat the scholars surmised was a mother and kid(interred with other daughters, in dirt, in other potter's fields). Above them, parades mark the passing of daysthrough parks where pale colonnades archin marble and steel, where all of the Twenty Thousand attending your foot fall(and the Cause that they died for)are lost in the idling birdcalls, and the records they left are cryptic at best, lost in obsolescence: the text will not yield(nor X-ray reveal, with any fluorescence)where the Hand of the Master begins and ends. I fell. I tried to do well, but I won't be. Will you tell the one that I lovedto remember, and hold me? I call and call for the doctor, but the snow swallows me whole, with old Florry Walker. The event lives only in print. ***He said, ""It's alright, and it's all over now, "" and boarded the plane, his belt unfastened, (The boy was known to show unusual daring—and called a 'boy', this aldermanconfounding Tammany Hall, in whose employ King Tamanend himself preceded John’s fall! )So we all raise a standardto which the wise and honest soul may repair; to which a hunter, a hundred years from now, may look, and despair, and see with wonderthe tributes we have left to rust in the park: swearing that our hair stood on end, to see John Purroy Mitchel depart for the Western Front, where work might count. All exeunt! All go out! Await the hunter, to decipher the stone(and what lies under, now). The city is gone. Look, and despair. Look, and despair. "
55,Divers (2015),Leaving the City,"Hay, and a clean stall, and ivy on a garden wall, and a sign saying Sold, and an old coatfor the bad cold. I believe in you. Do you believe in me? What do you want to do? Are we leaving the city? On the black road, through the gold fields, while the fields are plowed, towards what we are allowed. . . The bridle bends in idle handsand slows our canter to a trot. We mean to stop, in increments, but can’t commit. We post and sit, in impotence: the harder you hit, the deeper the dent. We seek our name. We seek our fame, and our credentials(paned in glass, trained to master incidentals). Bleach our collar, leech our dollar from our cents: the longer you live, the higher the rent. Beneath the pale sky, beside the red barn, below the white clouds, is all we are allowed. Here, the light will seep, and the scythe will reap, and spirit will rend, in counting toward the end. In December of that year, the word came down that she was here. The days grew shorter. I was sure, if she came 'round, I’d hold my ground. I'd endure. But they'd alluded to a changethat came to pass, and Spring, deranged, weeping grass and sleepless, broke herself upon my windowglass. And I could barely breathe, for seeingall the splintered light that leaked her fissures, fleeing, launched in flight: unstaunched daylight, brightly bleeding, bleached the night with dawn, deleting, in that high sun, after our good run, when the spirit bendsbeneath knowing it must end. And that is all I want here: to draw my gaunt spirit to bowbeneath what I am allowed. Beneath what I am allowed. "
56,Divers (2015),Goose Eggs,"What we built, at the kiln that won’t be stilled, did not set well: The old veil of desire, like the vessels that we fired, fell thin as eggshells. And every season, somebody burns, downtown, taking turns—taking a bus, to take a train and just plain vamoose. Now the wind blows coals over the hills. Honey, I’ve been paying my bills, but honey it’s been a long time since I’ve come to any use. And it hurt me bad, when I heard the newsthat you’d got that call, and could not refuse. (A goose, alone, I suppose, can know the loneliness of geese, who never find their peace, whether north, or south, or west, or east; west or east; and I could never find my wayto being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me, till the needing had ceased. )Recently, a bottle of rye, and a friend, and me, on our five loose legs, had a ramble, and spokeof the scrambling of broken hopes, and goose eggs, and a stranger, long ago. (Not you, honey! You, I know. )We just spoke of broken hopes and old strangers. Now the wind blows coals over the sea. Tell you what, honey: you and me better run and see if we can't contain them, first. But you had somewhere that you had to go, and you caught that flight out of Covalo. Now, overhead, you’re gunning in those Vs, where you had better find your peace, whether north, or south, or west, or east. West, or east. And I had better find my wayto being the kind of friend you seemed to need in me, at last (at least). What’s redacted will repeat, and you cannot learn that you burn when you touch the heat, so we touch the heat, and we cut facsimiles of love and death(just separate holes in sheetswhere you cannot breathe, and you cannot see). And I cannot now, for the life of me, believe our talk—our flock had cause to leave, but do we? do we? "
57,Divers (2015),Waltz of the 101st Lightborne,"I believed they had got what they came for; I believed our peril was done, on the eve of the last of the Great Wars, after three we had narrowly won. (But the fourth, it was carelessly done. )Saw his ship in its whistling ascension, as they launched from the Capitol seat—swear I saw our mistakewhen the clouds draped like a flag, across the backs of the fleetof the Hundred-First Lightborne Elite. As the day is long, so the well runs dry, and we came to see Time is tallerthan Space is wide. And we bade goodbyeto the Great Divide: found unlimited simulacreage to colonize! But there was a time we were lashed to the prowof a ship you may board, but not steer, before You and I ceased to mean Now, and began to mean only Right Here(to mean Inches and Miles, but not Years); before Space had a taste of its limits, and a new sort of coordinate awoke, making Time just another poor tenant: bearing weight, taking fire, trading smokes, in the war between us and our ghosts. (But I saw the Bering Strait and the Golden Gate, in silent suspension of their golden age! And you can barely tell, if I guard it well, where I have been, and seen, pristine, unfelled. )And I had a dream that I walked in the gardenof Chabot, and those telescope ruins. It was there that I called to my true love, who was pale as millennial moons, Honey, where did you come by that wound? When I woke, he was goneand the War had begun, in eternal return and repeat. Calling, Where in the hell are the rest of your fellow One Hundred-One Lightborne Elite? stormed in the New Highland Light Infantry. Make it stop, my love! We were wrong to try. Never saw what we could unravel, in traveling light, or how the trip debrides—like a stack of slides! All we saw was that Time is taller than Space is wide. That's why we got bound to a round desert island, 'neath the sky where our sailors have gone. Have they drowned, in those windy highlands? Highlands away, my John. "
58,Divers (2015),The Things I Say,"If I have the space of half a day, I'm ashamed of half the things I say. I'm ashamed to have turned out this way, and I desire to make amends. But it don't make no difference, now, and no-one's listening, anyhow, and lists of sins and solemn vowsdon't make you any friends. There's an old trick played, when the light and the wine conspireto make me think I'm fine. I'm not, but I have got half a mindto maybe get there, yet. When the sky goes pink in Paris, France, do you think of the girl who used to dancewhen you'd frame her moving within your hands, saying This I won't forget? What happened to the man you were, when you loved somebody before her? Did he die? Or does that man endure, somewhere far away? Our lives come easy and our lives come hard. And we carry them like a pack of cards: some we don't use, but we don't discard, but keep for a rainy day. "
59,Divers (2015),Divers,"The diver is my love(and I am his, if I am not deceived), who takes one breath above, for every hour below the sea; who gave to me a jewelworth twice this woman's life (but would cost her lessthan laying at low tide, to see her true love phosphoresce). And in an infinite regress: Tell me, why is the pain of birthlighter borne than the pain of death? I ain't saying that I loved you first, but I loved you best. I know we must abideeach by the rules that bind us here: the divers, and the sailors, and the women on the pier. But how do you choose your form? How do you choose your name? How do you choose your life? How do you choose the time you must exhale, and kick, and rise? And in an infinite capsize: Like a bull tearing down the coast, double hulls bearing double masts—I don't know if you loved me most, but you loved me last. Recall the word you gave: to count your way across the depths of this arid world, where you would yoke the waves, and lay a bed of shining pearls! I dream it every night: the ringing of the pail, the motes of sand dislodged, the shucking, quick and bright; the twinned and cast-off shells reveal a single heart of white. And in an infinite backslide: Ancient border, sink past the West, like a sword at the bearer's fall. I can't claim that I knew you best, but did you know me at all? A woman is alive! A woman is alive; you do not take her for a sign in nacre on a stone, alone, unfaceted and fine. And never will I wed. I'll hunt the pearl of death to the bottom of my life, and ever hold my breath, till I may be the diver's wife. See how the infinite divides: and the divers are not to blamefor the rift, spanning distant shores. You don't know my name, but I know yours. "
60,Divers (2015),Same Old Man,"It's the same old lady, putting out the wash, standing in the rain, in her mackintosh—same old lady standing in the rain! The thought of New York was going insane. Hey little leaf, lying on the ground—now you're turning slightly brown! Why don't you come back on the tree, turn the color green the way you ought to be? My mind is failing, and my body grows weak. And my lips won't form the words I speak. And I'm floating away on a barrel of pain. New York City won't see me again. It's the same old man, sitting at the mill, mill-wheel turning of its own free will. I'm certainly glad to be at home. New York City continues on, alone. I'm certainly glad to be at home. New York City continues on, alone. New York City continues on, alone. New York City continues. . . "
61,Divers (2015),You Will Not Take My Heart Alive,"And what do you remember most? The line of the sea, seceding the coast? Fine capillaries, glowing with cars? The comfort you drew from the light of the stars? And how long did you climb that night, with the ice in your lungs, on the rungs of the light? Beyond recall, you severed all stringsto everyone, and everything. Oh, silent, constant driver of mine: wordlessly calling from the end of the line, where, even though each hour I ever lovedmust queue and dive, still, you will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart. In martial wind, and in clarion rain, we minced into battle, wincing in pain; not meant for walking, backs bound in twine: not angel or devil, but level, in time. And I rose, to take my shape at last, from the dreams that had dogged me, through every past, when, to my soul, the body would say You may do what you like, as long as you stay. Now the towns and forests, highways and plains, fall back in circles like an emptying drain. And I won't come round this way again, where the lonely wind abides, and you will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart, alive. You will not take my heart. "
62,Divers (2015),A Pin-Light Bent,"My life comes and goes. My life comes and goes. Short flight, free rows: I lie down and doze. My life came and went. My life came and went. Short flight; free descent. Poor flight attendant. But the sky, over the ocean! And the ocean, skirting the city! And the city, bright as a garden(when the garden woke to meet me), from that height was a honeycombmade of light from those funny homes, intersected: each enclosed, anelectric and alone. In our lives is a common sensethat relies on the common fencethat divides, and attends, but provides scant defensefrom the Great Light that shines through a pin-hole, when the pin-light calls itself Selfhood, and the Selfhood inverts on a mirrorin an Amora Obscura. But it's mine. Or, at least, it's lent. And my life, until the time is spentis a pin-light, bent. It's a pin-light, bent. "
63,Divers (2015),"Time, As a Symptom","Time passed hard, and the task was the hardest thing she'd ever do. But she forgot, the moment she saw you. So it would seem to be true: when cruel birth debases, we forget. When cruel death debases, we believe it erases all the restthat precedes. But stand brave, life-liver, bleeding out your daysin the river of time. Stand brave: time moves both ways, in the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeatingjoy of life; the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeatingjoy of life. The moment of your greatest joy sustains: not axe nor hammer, tumor, tremor, can take it away, and it remains. It remains. And it pains me to say, I was wrong. Love is not a symptom of time. Time is just a symptom of love(and of the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeatingjoy of life; the nullifying, defeating, negating, repeatingjoy of life). Hardly seen, hardly felt—deep down where your fight is waiting, down 'till the light in your eyes is fading: joy of life. Where I know that you can yield, when it comes down to it; bow like the field when the wind combs through it: joy of life. And every little gust that chances throughwill dance in the dust of me and you, with joy-of-life. And in our perfect secret-keeping: One ear of corn, in silent, reapingjoy of life. Joy! Again, around—a pause, a sound—a song: a way a lone a last a loved a long. A cave, a grave, a day: arise, ascend. (Areion, Rharian, go free and graze. Amen. )A shore, a tide, unmoored—a sight, abroad: A dawn, unmarked, undone, undarked (a god). No time. No flock. No chime, no clock. No end. White star, white ship—Nightjar, transmit: transcend! White star, white ship—Nightjar, transmit: transcend! White star, white ship—Nightjar, transmit: transcend! White star, white ship—Nightjar, transmit: trans"
64,Unreleased,Make Hay,"So long So long So long So long So long My old friend died that way: The accumulation of time And the passing of days Though she dug in her heels Drug her wheels in the clay—She dotted her eyes; Crossed the teasels in her leaning dray Where buzzards make circles(And tillers make hay): A dozen in kettle, committee & wake; Where wind made the dust, And sin made the snake, And Mama made us. But what did I make? And how was I to know, Down in our old goldmine Where you were the king of the radio And I was the keeper of Hi-Fi, And I was the queen of the rodeo(And everybody’d know), And you were the keeper of the lions; And we were gored, and abased, And adored, and erased, All before our time? It was before our time. So how was I to know? How was I to know, While the tune hums, And the hand strikes the gong, And all of us plough our row, And the notes run Out of measure and out of time and landing wrong? Well the day is long, But not so long. My old friend died alone, Save for the friends And family she had known Surrounding her bed, None of whom in that room Could with certainty have said, “I’ve dotted my eyes Crossed the teasels in my leaning sled, Where buzzards make circles, And tillers make hay: In windrow and bale, With tedder and rake; Where Adam made ribs And cattle make steak. ”(And the rattling nib writes, “What did I make? ”)And how was I to know Seeing my seconds pass in a line If there was a way to reckon love Except as a symptom of time? And honey, it stretched out below us, Humming every note From the lowest to the highest, but even at the highest, We were bored, and amazed, In accord, in a daze, All before our time. It was before our time. So how was I to know? How was I to know? How was I to know? How was I to know? While the day slows, And the sun stares, stalling, Into the dimming barrel of night, Where the stars are falling? I’ve got no say, But still, I’m calling for my old friend. We sow and we reap, again.

69,Unreleased,No Wonder,"Take it with me, love To a place it can be loved Little bird, little stone, shine In light of the undying Dig with your hands, dear Gather our friends dear And I will cover in dust, dear Silence and trust dear. Stay through the winter Wait for the splinter, And the green in the springtime Queen and her king time Sweetness all summer and fall Hit like a tremor And split in the autumn Pit with no bottom. And after the fall, out in the country In the long drought with you, honey And I call(? ), daughter and son Ours to adore whatever may come After our chores end, and our money And our scores are settled and done Darling I will stay til the last Plates are all filled, trays are all passed Ain’t it a thrill, ain’t it a gas? Forded(? ) the hill, and don’t it go fast? At the foot of the hill, we empty our glasses And I’ll follow you over, Will you follow me under? Crawl through the shadows, Call out the wonder. Oh how I’ll love you, Time will tell–I’ll never tire of you. I’m just tired of myself, dear. And as our days, waft in a ream All patters(? ) away, soft as a dream We laugh and we race Off and on, we Capture a stray pod on a breeze Hammer a stake, mark in our seed Manage to rake, water, and weed Hundred to one our garden will grow But wonder or none, I wanna be known Wanna be stung, wanna be shown Want for no one but you and your Warm openin’ arms Watching the rolling storm clouds sail byour window and darken the valley Pale, pocked, and dimpled Crocodile bellies We wait all night and count the thunder There is no lightning It is no wonder. But just before dawn, water comes streaming In the dark, every bead Burns like a star, blinking to sleep Burns like a spark, burrowing deep Under the lawn, quiet and green Rain has begun, honey come see Under the sun, rising like steam Wonder or none, I wanna be seen Wanna be–eventually, eventually Grow through the winter, and summer Surely and slowly Little stone, shine of wonder At home with you only"
