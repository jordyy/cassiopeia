we picked our way down to the beach watching the waves dragging out of our reach tangling tails like a sodden sheet dangling entrails from the gut of the sea hoarding our meals alfalfa and rolls trying not to catch the cold eye of the gulls —i hope mother nature has not overheard though she doles out hurt like a puking bird we stayed for the winter noone told us about the laws of the land i hold my own but you with your hunger you on the other hand make yourself known and when we were found i know we both grieved my heart made the sound ofsnow falling from eaves you and me bess we was as thick as thieves so i swore nonetheless up and down it was only me so they took me away and after some time studying my case must have made up their minds by the time you realized i was dying must have been too late i believe you were not lying it is the day i wake with my ears cocked up like a gun like every day of course yanked by my wrists to the sugar front courtyard now tell me what have i done seems i have stolen a horse and i step to the gallows who do you think that you are arching your hooves like a crane in the shallow gutter that lines the boulevards crowded with folks who just stare as i hang its all the same kindness comes over me what was your nameit makes no difference im glad that you came forever ill listen to your glad neighing 
my heart became a drunken runton the day i sunk in this shunt to tap me clean of all the wonder and the sorrow i have seen since i left my home my home on the old milk lake where the darkness does fall so fast it feels like some kind of mistake just like they told you it would just like the tulgey wood when i came into my land i did not understand neither dry rot nor the burn pile nor the bark beetle nor the dry well nor the black bear but there is another who is a little older when i broke my bone he carried me up from the riverside to spend my life in spitting distance of the love that i have known i must stay here in an endless even tide and if you come and see me you will upset the order you cannot come and see me for i set myself apart but when you come and see me in california you cross the border of my heart well i have sown untidy furrows across my soul but i am still a coward content to see my garden grow so sweet full of someone elses flowers sometimes i can almost feel the power sometimes i am so in love with you like a little clock that trembles on the edge of the hour only ever calling out cuckoo cuckoo when i called you you little one in a bad way did you love me do you spite me time will tell if i can be well and rise to meet you rightly while moving across my land brandishing themselveslike a burning branch advance the tallow colored walleyed deer quiet as gondoliers while i wait all night for you in california watching the fox pick off my goldfish from their sorry golden state and i am no longer afraid of anything save the life that here awaits i dont belong to anyone my heart is heavy as an oil drum i dont want to be alone my heart is yellow as an ear of corn and i have torn my soul apart from pulling artlessly with fool commands some nights i just never go to sleep at all and i stand shaking in my doorway like a sentinel all alone bracing like the bow upon a ship and fully abandoningany thought of anywherebut home my home sometimes i can almost feel the power and i do love you is it only timing that has made it such a dark hour only ever chiming out cuckoo cuckoomy heart i wear you down i know gotta think straight keep a clean plate keep from wearing down if i lose my head just where am i going to lay itfor it has halfruined me to be hanging around here among the daphne blooming out of the big brown i am native to it but im overgrown i have choked my rootson the earth as rich as roe here down in california 
i was tired of being drunk my face cracked like a joke so i swung through here like a brace of jackrabbits with their necks all broke i stumbled at the door with my boot and i knocked against the jamb and i scrabbled at your chest like a mute with my fists of ham trying to tell you that i am telling you i can i can love you again love you again im squinting towards the east my faith makes me a dope but you can take my hand in the darkness darling like a length of rope i shaped up overnight you know the day after she died when i saw my heart and ill tell you darling it was open wide what with telling you i am telling you i can i can love you again love you again and it can have no bounds you know it can have no end you can take my hand in the darkness darling when you need a friend and it can change in shape or form but never change in size well the water it ran deep my darling where it dont run wide the feather of a hawk was bound bound around my neck a poultice made of fig the eager little vultures pecked and a verse i read in jest in matthew spoke to me said theres a flame that moves like a lowdown pest and says you will be free only tell me that i can tell me that i can i can love you again love you again love you again love you again love you again love you again love you again love you again love you again love you again love you again love you   
last night again you were in my dream several expendable limbs were at stake you were a prince spinning rims all sentiments indian given and halfbaked i was brought in on a palanquinmade of the many bodies of beautiful women brought to this place to be examined swaying on an elephanta princess of india we both want the very same thing we are praying i am the one to save you but you dont even own your own violence run away from home your beard is still blue with the loneliness of you mighty men with your jaws and fists and guitars and pens and your sugarlip but ive never been to the firepits with you mighty men who made you this waywho made you this waywho is going to bear your beautiful children do you think you can just stop when youre ready for a change who will take care of you when youre old and dying you burn in the mekong to prove your worth go long go long right over the edge of the earth you have been wronged tore up since birth you have done harm others have done worse will you tuck your shirt will you leave it loose you are badly hurt youre a silly goose you are caked in mud and in blood and worse chew your bitter cud grope your little nurse do you know why my ankles are bound in gauze sickly dressage a princess of kentucky in the middle of the woods which were the probable cause we danced in the lodge like two panting monkeys i will give you a call for one last hurrah and if this tale is tall forgive my scrambling but you keep palming along the wall moving at a blind crawl but always rambling wolfspider crouch in your funnel nest if i knew you once now i know you less in the sinking sand where weve come to rest have i had a hand in your loneliness when you leave me alone in this old palace of yours it starts to get to me i take to walking what a woman does is open doors and it is not a question of lockingor unlocking well i have never seensuch a terrible room —gilded with the gold teethof the women who loved younow though i die magpie this i bequeathby any other name a jay is still bluewith the lonelinessof you mighty men with your mighty kissthat might never never end while so far away in the seat of the west burns the fountof the heatof that loneliness theres a manwho only will speak in code backing slowly slowly down the road may he master everythingthat such men may knowabout loving and then letting go 
mercy me the night is long take my pen to write you this song lord is it harder to carry on or to know when you are done all my life ive felt as though im inside a beautiful memory replaying with the sound turned down low long life show your face slow heart curb your taste smoke me out of my hiding place longlife state your case what in the world are we waiting for building glowing cities along the shore where the wind batters in baiting my kin like a matador so much value placed upon what lies just beyond our plans waving my handkerchief running along till the end of the sand longlife speak your name so tired of the guessing game but something is moving just out of frame slow heart brace and aim breaching slowly across the sea one mast a flash like the stinger of a bee to take you away a swarming fleet is gonna take you from me the universe is getting loose sodden spread from some leaden disuse rushing unhinged toward diminishing lights like a headless caboose ill wait for you alongside the ocean and make do with my no skin but then long life will you let me inand then slow heart are you gonna know him long life speak your name i wait while i decry the wait and when i die may i relate slow heart congregate to leave your home and your family for some distortion of property well darling i cant go but you may stay here with me 
so so long ago and so far away when time was just a line that you fed me when you wanted to stay wed talk as soft as chalk till morning came pale as a pearl no time no time now i have got all the time in the world say honey did you belong to me tell me honey was your heart at rest when darlin all the mourning doves were howling usa song of loves godawful lawlessness lawlessness say honey did you belong to me tell me honey did i pass your test i lay as still as death until the dawn where upon i wrested from your godawful lawlessness lawlessness i roam around the tidy grounds of my dappled sanatorium coatless i sit amongst the motes adrift and i dote upon my pinesap gum and the light through the pines in brassy tines lays over me dim as rum and thick as molasses and so time passes and so my heart tomorrow comes i feel you leaning out back with the crickets loyal heart marking the soonness darkness tonight still the mourning doves will summon us their songof loves neverdoneing lawlessness lawlessness while over and over rear up stand down lay round trying to sound out or guess the reasons i sleep like a soldier without rest but there is no treason where there is only lawlessness lawlessness in the last week of the last year i was aware i took a blind shot across the creek at the black bear when he roused me in the night and left me cowering with my light calling out who is there whos there who is there i watched you sleep repeating my prayer you give love a little shove and it becomes terror and now i am calling in a sadness beyond anger and beyond fear who is there whos there who is there i glare and nod like the character god bearing down upon the houses and lawns i knew a little bit but darling you were it and darling now it is long gone sweetheart in your clean bright start back there behind a hill and a dell and a state line or two —ill be thinking of you yes ill be thinking and be wishing you well we land i stand but i wait for the sound of the bell i have to catch a cab and my bags are at the carousel and then — lord just then —time alone will only tell you mourning dove 
i can feel a difference today a difference all of us in our tents fearing god like a mistress we lay on the rocks in the sun watching you and your mama row in i sat up and blinked when you appeared so pale you were nearly clear later i stumbled to my bed all alone in the branches i laid in the dark thinking about all of my friends and their changes and i do not know if you know just what you have done you are the sweetest one i have ever laid my eyes upon its a beautiful town with the rain coming down blackberry rosemary jimmycrackcorn youve got the run of the place now that youre running around and may kindness kindness kindness abound in this hour of our lives hour of effortless plenty how do we know which parts of our hearts want what with such base generosity taking so many photographs so amazed weve never seen a baby so newlyborn and when the bulbs do flash as bright as morning the crowd keeps on gathering like an electric storm the phantom of love moves among us at will each phantom limb lost has got an angel so confused like the wagging bobbedtail of a bulldog kindness kindness prevails kindness prevail sties and rails ties and rails fall into line bearing kindness where will you go if not here what will you say when you write to usand this is a world of terrible hardship everywhere and i search for words to set you at ease but there in the looking glass a kite is soaring stilling my warring heartand my trembling knees clean as a breeze bright as the day all of the people gather to say sweet esme sweet esme oh oh oh i believe love will always surround you brave as a bear with a heart rare and true but if you are scared if you are blue i have prepared this small song for you sweet esme sweet esme oh oh oh sweet esme sweet esme oh oh oh sweet esme esme sweet esme sweet esme oh oh oh
driven through by her own sword summer died last night alone even the ghosts huddled up for warmth autumn has come to my hometown friendly voices dead and gone singing star of the country down even the ghosts help raise the barn here now in my hometown when out of the massing that bodes and bides in the cold west flew a waxwing who froze and died against my breast and all the while rain like a weed in the tide swans and lists down on the gossiping lawns saying tsk tsk tsk i may have changed its hard to gauge time wont account for how ive aged would i could tie your lying tongue who says that leaving keeps you young and i have got no control over my heart over my mind over the hills the rainclouds roll ill winter here wait for a signto cast myself out over the water riven like a wishbone youd hardly guess i was my own mothers daughter i aint naturally given to roam and i lay low when i return and i move like a gurney whose wheels are squeaking alone here in my home and i laugh when you speak of my pleasure seeking among the tall pines along the laylines here where the loon keens there where the moon leans there where i know my violent love lays down in a row of silent dove gray days here in a row of silent dove gray days wherever i go i am snowbound by thoughts of him whom i would shun i loved them all one by one cannot gain ground cannot outrun but time marches along you cant always stick around but when the final count is done i will be in my hometown i will be in my hometown 
there is a spring not far from here the water runs both sweet and clear both sweet and clear and cold could crack your bones with veins of gold i stood awagging at the tap just awaiting on the lagging rising sap i held the cold tin ladle to my lip at the shrine of the thousand arms i lowered my eyes to sip what a beautiful day to catch my drift or be caught up in it you want your love love come and get your love i only took it back because i thought you didnt how my ears did ring at the municipal pound from that old hangdog to which i was bound curled round the bottom rung doesnt nobody want you well come on darlin i could use someone like you around i am not like you i aint from this place and i do reserve the right to repeat all my same mistakes and in the night like you i certainly bite and chew what i can find and never seem to lose the taste what a horrible face i feel me make for petes sake what you have told me i cannot erase though i keep on saying and i do believe it is not too late all day youre hassling me with trifles black nose of the dog as cold as a rifle indicating with a nudge god no god god no god sweet appraising eye of the dog blink once if god twice if no god my mama may be ashamed of me with all of my finery carrying on whooping it up till the early morn lost and lorn among the madding revelry sure i can pass honey i can pass particularly when i start to tip my glass ill be a sport and have a go at that old song singing unabashed about them city girls with their ribbon bows and their fancy sash but though i get so sad could swear the night makes a motion to claim me around that second verse i reckon ive felt worse and still held fast but later on when i am alone alone at last well i take my god to task i take my daggone god to task 
whose is the hand that i will hold whose is the face i will see whose is the name that i will call when i am called to meet thee in this life who did you love beneath the drifting ashes beneath the sheeting banks of air that barrenly bore our rations when i could speak it was too late didnt you hear me calling didnt you see my heart leap like a pup in the constant barley in this life where did you crouch when the sky had set to boiling burning within seen from without and your gut was a serpent coiling and for the sake of that pit of snakes for whom did you allay your shyness and spend all your mercy and madness and grace in a day beneath the bending cypress it was not on principal show pro heart that you have got gall a miracle i can bear a lot but not that pall i can bear a lot but not that pall king fisher sound the alarm say sweet little darlin now come to my arms tell me all about the love you left on the farm he was a kind unhurried man with a heavy lip and a steady hand but he loved me just like a little child like a little child loves a little lamb thrown to the ground by something down there bitten by the bad air while the clouds tick trying to read all the signs preparing for when the bombs hit hung from the underbelly of the earth while the stars skid away below gormless and brakeless gravel loose falling silent as gavels in the snow i lay back and spit my chaw wrapped in the long arm of the law who has seen it all i can bear a lot but not that pall i can bear a lot but not that pall kingfisher cast your fly oh lord it happens without even trying when i sling a low look from my shuttering eye blows rain upon the one you loved and though you were only sparring theres blood on the eye unlace the glove say honey i am not sorry stand here and namethe one you loved beneath the drifting ashes and in naming rise above time as it flashing passes we came by the boatload and were immobilizedworshipping volcanoes charting the loping skies the tides of the earthleft us bound and calcified and made as obstinate as obsidian unmoving save our eyesjust mooning and blinkingfrom faces marked with coal ash cooling and shrinkingcracks loud as thunder rolling i swear i know you you know me where have we met beforetell me trueto whose authoritydo you consign your souli had a dream you came to me said you shall not do me harm anymore and with your knife you evicted my lifefrom its little lighthouseon the seashore and i saw that my bloodhad no bounds spreading in a circle like an atom bomb soaking and fellingeverything in its path and welling in my heart like a birdbath it is too short —the day we are born we commence with our dying trying to serve with the heart of a child kingfisher lie with the lion 
i will pack up my pretty dresses i will box up my highheeled shoes a sparkling ring for every finger ill put away and hide from view coats of bouclé jacquard and cashmere cartouche and tweed all silver shot and everything that could remind you of how easy i was not ill tuck away my gilded buttons ill bind my silks in shapeless bales wrap it all on up in reams of tissue and then ill kiss you sweet farewell you saw me rise to our occasion and so deny the evidence caused me to burn and twist and grimace against you like something caught on a barbedwire fence now you can see me fall back here redoubled full bewildered and amazed i have gotten into some terrible trouble beneath your blank and rinsing gaze it does not suffice for you to say i am a sweet girl or to say you hate to see me sad because of you it does not suffice to merely lie beside each other as those who love each other do i picture you rising up in the morning stretching out on your boundless bed beating a clear path to the shower scouring yourself red the tap of hangers swaying in the closet unburdened hooks and empty drawers and everywhere i tried to love you is yours again and only yours
